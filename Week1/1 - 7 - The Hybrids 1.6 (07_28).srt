1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:03,950
Alright.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,250
Welcome back, and this is the final
lecture of week one, The Hybrids.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,510
Now just kind of as review, you know, one

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,280
to bring up again, the, the family of
Equidae.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,670
And that includes horses, donkeys, and
zebras, and so the hybrids

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,740
is going to be the, the combination of, of
two of those.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,280
So you can see the general definition of a
hybrid, and you

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,270
know, it's important to, to kind of
understand how these come about.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,500
So, if I was going to take say a Shire
horse and breed

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,620
it to a thoroughbred both are equus
caballus so that's not a hybrid.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,120
That's a crossbred.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,690
So, that wouldn't be considered what we
call hybrid.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,960
But, if you took that Shire horse and bred
it to a Mammoth Jack

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,760
donkey which I would really like to see
the offspring of, of these matings.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,900
So that's Equus caballus and Equus asinus,
then you would get a hybrid.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,600
So that's two species, distinct species
that you're breeding.

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,164
Now, creating hybrids within Equids is not
really that easy.

18
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:07,190
And it's really because a lot of the

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,310
Equids have a different total number of
chromosomes.

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,290
And so it's worthwhile to just kind of
briefly cover what chromosomes

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,850
are and how they come about you know,
forming new organisms.

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,450
Now the chromosomes are stored in, in the
nucleus of almost

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,338
all cells and that contains all the DNA or
genetic material, you

24
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:28,218
know and tells it to do its function or
program or

25
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:32,530
develop into a baby horse and, and so on
and so forth.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,380
Now, during mating half the genetic
material comes from

27
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,570
mom and half the genetic material comes
from dad.

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,150
They come together and they combine and
form you know, offspring or the foal.

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,030
So, if we took the example of the horse,
the

30
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,040
mom has in her oocyte or her eggs, has 32
chromosomes.

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,300
And then dad's cell, the sperm cell that

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,050
comes in and fertilizes the egg has 32
chromosomes.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,350
They combine and the horse is going to
have a total of 64 chromosomes per cell.

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,340
So, so that's important to remember.

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,160
Now again, when these chromosomes come
together, you

36
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,210
have one from mom and one from dad.

37
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:23,240
And so they're going to come and combine
and match up like this.

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,830
And then those are, that's chromosome, say
that's chromosome one.

39
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,440
And then, individual chromosome two from
mom, individual chromosome

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,180
two from dad comes together, fuses, that's
chromosome two.

41
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,490
Then chromosome three, and so forth.

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,340
You know, through all of the chromosomes
of

43
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,650
the horse to where there's 64 total
chromosomes.

44
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,560
So we can say the horse has 64.

45
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,760
Now when we go through the other Equids,
say donkeys, they have 62.

46
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,440
So you know, and we're going to talk about
mules and hinnies here in a second,

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,100
but when you mate a horse and mate

48
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,840
a donkey, the offspring's going to have 63
chromosomes.

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,010
Which is a mule or a hinny.

50
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,120
Now, the three different zebra species
actually have different chromosomes.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,990
So, it complicates it a little bit more.

52
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,732
So, the plain zebra has 44, and then the
mountain zebra has 32.

53
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,460
And then the Grevy's zebra has 46.

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,410
So you can see the Mountain zebra has

55
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,400
the lowest of any Equid with only 32
chromosomes.

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,210
So half of what a horse has.

57
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,830
So when you're mating these two species
with the horse oocyte

58
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,810
with 32 chromosomes and the Mountain zebra
who has 32 total chromosomes.

59
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,270
So when I say that remember half comes
from mom half comes from dad.

60
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,270
So their egg and sperm have half that
number.

61
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,040
So 32 so it's 16.

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,626
So the mountain zebra sperm cell only has
16 chromosomes.

63
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:58,782
It's going to come together, line up with
that horse oocyte, line up 16 chromosomes,

64
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:01,340
and then that actually leaves 16
individual

65
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,780
chromosomes from the horse with no, no
pairing.

66
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,926
So, those genes that are there, that are,

67
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:10,170
that, that those genetics are, are in
essence, lost.

68
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,860
So, that's why a lot of these hybrids
fail, because you're

69
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,950
not getting proper you know, combination
of the genes to produce offspring.

70
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,290
Now, we're going to talk about the, the
first hybrid is

71
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,870
the horse and donkey hybrid, and it
results in two types.

72
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,430
So if you mate a female horse to a male
donkey or

73
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,360
a jack, so a mare to a jack, you get a
mule.

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,320
And what's interesting is this, this is
pretty successful.

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,450
So, they get a 90% ferti, fertility rate,

76
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,170
you know, really good fertilization rate
and reproductive rate.

77
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,380
And that's probably why we see so many
mules

78
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,780
in the world today, over 10 million, is
because

79
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,530
you made them and, just, just like any
other

80
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,190
horses, or donkeys, you know they, they
have good rates.

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,760
Now when you do the reverse, and so you do
a jenny, or a

82
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,770
female donkey to a stallion, or a male
horse, we don't see the same results.

83
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,610
And this is called a hinny.

84
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,130
And they actually have fertilization rates
or fertility rates less than 15%.

85
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,150
So, that's why they're a lot more rare.

86
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,300
So, you know, in science, at, as
scientists,

87
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,900
we have not really found the reason why.

88
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,960
You know, we've looked in the literature,
and there's really no

89
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,090
reason why this doesn't work as well as
the reverse, making mules.

90
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,863
Now, it's also remember, important to
remember that

91
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,080
their offspring are going to have 63 total
chromosomes.

92
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,360
So you got 64 from the horse, 62, 62 from
the donkey.

93
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
You know, you bring those together, you're

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,530
going to get 63 and they're going to be
sterile.

95
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,280
So that's why you don't see mules
breeding, because they're sterile.

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,840
Now horse and zebra hybrids have, have
been successful, and they have

97
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
actually been successful across all three

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,970
zebra species, which is really
interesting.

99
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,830
So, it is possible, but, you know, their

100
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,640
fertility rates aren't, aren't as great,
as you'll see.

101
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,600
These are actually called Zorses or
Zebroids.

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,700
Now Zebroids can mean you know, as we'll

103
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,490
see in a second, the horse and donkey
hybrids.

104
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,260
But I like to just think of Zorses.

105
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,740
I think its a, its a cool name and, and
every time I see

106
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,440
pictures of these I'm always amazed you

107
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,310
know, that, that they were successful
doing that.

108
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,370
And again their fertility is greatly
reduced because the

109
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,630
mixing of those chromosomes doesn't always
result in, in offspring.

110
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,210
Now, donkey and zebra hybrids, those are
possible too.

111
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,600
And again, they're known as Zebroids, but,
or, you can call

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,800
them Zonkeys which again, is a kind of a
cool name.

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,410
So, you know call them a Zonkey.

114
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,060
And their fertility again is greatly
reduced.

115
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,690
The mixing of those chromosomes doesn't
always work right, so you know, it, it's

116
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,829
kind of a, somewhat more rare occurrence
than breeding two of the same species.

117
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,150
So, this brings us to the end of week one.

118
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,050
And, you know, thank you for, for taking
the time to watch all the lectures.

119
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,410
Just a quick reminder, take quiz one and

120
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,160
for next week, we're going to start
jumping into physiology.

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,720
We're going to start talking a little bit
about coat

122
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,500
colors, some more, some more terminology,
and then jump into

123
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,350
hoof care and then kind of develop you
know, a hoof

124
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,660
care plan, and I look forward to seeing
you then.
