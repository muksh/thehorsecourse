1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:03,980
All right.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,300
Well, welcome to our first lecture, the
World's Equids.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,010
Now you may ask yourself, what's an equid.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,770
And it, it's kind of the term for these

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,080
animals that fall under this taxonomic
family known as Equidae.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,880
So you know, the, the, the first one that
falls into Equidae is, is the horse.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,590
Which, you know?

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,440
Obviously, this course is about.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,640
And the two scientific terms for the horse
is Equus caballus and Equus ferus.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,300
Now Equus caballus is for the domestic
type horse.

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,080
And then Equus ferus is for the wild

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,160
type horse, which today is, is the
Przewalski horse.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,860
That's, that's the only one that, that,
that's left of the wild type.

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,190
Even though we have you know, feral horses
from Equus caballus that,

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,260
that have been released in the wild, and,
and are now feral.

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,180
They're still Equus caballus.

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,150
Now the next classification of an equid is
a donkey

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,690
or an ass, as known throughout many parts
of the world.

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,350
And their scientific name is Equus asinus.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,530
And then the final member of this family
is the zebra.

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,890
So, you know, there's many subspecies of
Equus that are

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,410
zebras that we're going to talk about
later in this lecture.

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,440
So, I couldn't really fit them all on this
line here.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,390
But, there's one more that we, we can't
forget about.

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,060
So, we have the horses, the donkeys and

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,010
the zebras, but you can also consider
these hybrids.

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,400
Which, really is the most common is the
mule.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,550
As an equid.

29
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,710
So they, they are equids they're just a
cross

30
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,570
species of you know, Equus caballus and
Equus asinus,

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,200
or there's actually zhorses and zonkeys
which in the

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,520
lecture later this week that you'll lean
more about.

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,290
Now the next thing we want to look at

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,690
is the global population and the best
information

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,270
I could find is this report from the

36
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,090
Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations.

37
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,340
And they update, you know, livestock
species, you

38
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,930
know, throughout the world, through
surveys or estimations.

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,405
And their last estimate from 2011 is,
there's

40
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:06,160
58,million horses on earth, which is
pretty amazing.

41
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,590
And then if we look at donkeys, or

42
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,730
asses, there's another 43 million equids
out there.

43
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,340
So again, you know, you have 58 million
horses, 43 million donkeys.

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,920
And then, this was really surprising to
me.

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,680
I didn't realize how many mules we
actually have on Earth, around the world.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,960
And there's over 10 million mules, which
is, which is really cool.

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,290
So, overall we're looking at a 111 million
equids, you know,

48
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,660
donkeys, horses and mules around, you
know, many continents and [UNKNOWN].

49
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,050
But the only one whether it's in the horse

50
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,460
because they probably couldn't survive
down there very well.

51
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,900
But you know what's really exciting about
that is, you know, with all of

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,260
these, these animals, is there's all those

53
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,540
owners, that are enthusiastic about owning
them.

54
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,000
We actually need them.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,944
In their daily lives to, to run their
business or to get to work or to do

56
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:56,120
the things that man has been doing with

57
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,940
horses for and donkeys and mules for 6,000
years.

58
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,420
So, pretty exciting data there.

59
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,920
Now if we look at breaking it down by
country, I just listed the top seven.

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
And the United States came in ranked

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,010
number one with over 10 million horses,
which

62
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,130
wasn't too surprising to me because, you
know,

63
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,600
the horse hot bed here in the States.

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,030
But you go down this list you know China

65
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,490
has 6.7 million, still huge population of
horses there.

66
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,310
Mexico 6.3 million, breaking it down and
the one country that really

67
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,310
surprised me was Ethiopia with over 2
million head of horses in it.

68
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,970
I was really surprised that they had that
many more than Russia.

69
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,900
And then if you go look at the donkeys

70
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,870
or the asses, Ethiopia's number one with
6.5 million.

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,540
You know then again breaking it down, you
know, China, Pakistan, Egypt.

72
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,780
I was fortunate enough to, to be in Egypt
a few years ago and I,

73
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,040
I saw plenty of donkeys still pulling
carts

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,550
you know, work in the fields with
agriculture.

75
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,310
You know big part of their life there

76
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,890
in Egypt, beautiful animals, you know
Mexico and then

77
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,850
a couple of other countries in Africa,
Niger and

78
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,080
Nigeria huge populations of donkeys that
are still working.

79
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,120
For their owners today.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,330
And then when you break down this
population of mules, Mexico came in

81
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,650
number one with 3.2 million, and then

82
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,070
China there, Brazil, Morocco, there's
Ethiopia again.

83
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,340
So, Ethiopia has a huge equid population.

84
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,720
Peru and Argentina.

85
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,200
Now we can't forget the other, you know,
the, the wild type animals.

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,540
Now Equus ferus, there's a few thousand.

87
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,700
There's Przewalski horses still roaming.

88
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,900
You know, in Mongolia and China they were
re-released, so they're,

89
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,870
they're still out there in some preserves
as we reestablish that population.

90
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,031
So.

91
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:44,580
Really only the true wild equids are the
zebras and the wild asses.

92
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,890
So if we look first at the plains zebra
you can see their scientific

93
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,750
name Equus quagga and this is what

94
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,760
everybody thinks of when they think of
zebras.

95
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,940
They think back to the Serengeti Plain you
know, in Tanzania, running away from

96
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,695
predators and you know, that's what we
typically think of and there's over 600.

97
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:04,510
60,000 of these animals.

98
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,410
So they're still doing relatively well in
the wild, but

99
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,050
the other two populations of zebras are,
aren't doing so hot.

100
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,065
The first is the mountain zebra, you

101
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:16,280
know, Equus zebra, and they're listed as
vulnerable.

102
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,040
There's only about 9,000 of these animals
left

103
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,070
and they're in the southwestern region of,
of Africa.

104
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,390
And what's unique about these animals too
is you can see that dewlap right there.

105
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,080
And that was.

106
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,730
That's important because these animals
are, you know, in hotter parts of Africa.

107
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,390
And that helps them thermoregulate that
extra skin.

108
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,790
So it, it's really cool if you ever see
these at a, at a zoo

109
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,190
or if you're fortunate enough to see them
in the wild, you can see that dewlap.

110
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,350
And it, it, it's pretty unique, to them.

111
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,530
And then the other zebra species is the
Grevy's zebra.

112
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,060
And this is the one that's endangered.

113
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,080
There's, there's about 2000 animals left.

114
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,820
And they range from really central to
southeastern Africa.

115
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,140
And I've done a little bit of work with
these guys.

116
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,450
And you know, really need to be

117
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,310
aware that they are endangered, they're
being overhunted.

118
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,540
You know, they're in competition with,
with livestock in that part of the world.

119
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,960
And, and just kind of a, you know,
something to

120
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,670
be aware of that those animals are, are in
trouble.

121
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,870
And then, you know, we don't want them to
end

122
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,840
up like the quagga here which went extinct
in 1875.

123
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,478
And what's really cool about this one is.

124
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:25,360
You know, it looks like a half

125
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,690
zebra half donkey, and unfortunately
there's, there's no

126
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,860
live specimens anymore and we, we actually

127
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,330
can't look at these animals in their
beauty.

128
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,750
Now there, there's two major classes of,
of wild donkeys, or wild asses.

129
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,810
And there's the African wild ass and the
Asiatic

130
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,000
wild ass, so our domestic populations came
from these animals.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,420
And what's left of the African wild ass is
really only the Somali wild ass.

132
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,940
And there's maybe 600 animals left in the
world.

133
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,930
And it's really unfortunate.

134
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,750
You can see here the the Somali wild ass.

135
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,240
You know, with that leg striping, these
are beautiful animals.

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,120
I've been fortunate enough to do some
research with these guys and I, and

137
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,220
I hope to continue to do research with
them in trying to save this population.

138
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,500
I really hope they don't go extinct in my
lifetime even though that's what

139
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,320
it's looking like as they, they lose their
habitat and, and, and some other problems.

140
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,890
And then.

141
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,600
Next to that is the the Nubian wild ass

142
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,750
that went extinct within probably the last
20 years.

143
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,690
It's certainly extinct in the wild and.

144
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,400
You can see what's unique about this is,

145
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,550
this one had the stripe over the
shoulders.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,610
So when you look at domestic donkeys
today, which we will later in the week.

147
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,470
Looking at breeds of donkeys you can still
see leg stripping and that back

148
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,389
stripe you know, from their original
Nubian wild ass and the Somali wild ass.

149
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,980
Now the Asiatic wild asses, they're,
they're ones

150
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,960
known as you know, the onagers, the
kulans.

151
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,550
These are endangers, so there's maybe
8,000 of these left in the wild.

152
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,290
So again competition with, with humans.

153
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,600
You know also a, a major danger to these
populations is, you know feral

154
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,320
donkeys that get away from their owners

155
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,580
are actually breeding with the wild
population.

156
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,470
So you get a mixing of the genetics and
you no longer have a

157
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,660
true wild, you know Asiatic wild donkey or
a true wild African wild donkey.

158
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,930
So, so anyways, but they, they are out

159
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,700
there and they are part of what's an
equid.

160
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,780
Now, our next lecture is we're going to
start with the evolution of, of the horse

161
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,360
and, to a lesser extent, donkeys and

162
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,990
zebras, where they, they all have common
