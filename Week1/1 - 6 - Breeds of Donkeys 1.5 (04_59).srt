1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,320
Alright, welcome back.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,830
In this lecture we're going to cover some

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,780
different breeds of donkeys found
throughout the world.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,220
Now, just really quickly I want to do a
quick review.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,530
Just so, you kind of remember where
donkeys originated from

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,750
and coming from two, you know, regions of
the world.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,210
The Asiatic wild asses, and then the
African wild asses.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,680
And in a lot of the pictures you'll see in
this

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,520
lecture, you will be able to, to at least
see some

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,800
of the, the similarities in, in the
co-patterns, where you have

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,080
that striping along the shoulder, that
came from the Nubian wild ass.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,680
And then the striping on the legs that we
typically see in the Somali wild ass.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,540
So, you'll see that in some of the
pictures of, of the breeds that we have.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,020
Now quickly before we, you know, jump into

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,810
the different breeds, we have to cover
some terminology.

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,420
Now, in horses, male horses are known as,
as stallions.

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,910
In donkeys and in some of the hybrids that
we'll

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,050
talk about in,in the next lecture, they're
referred to as jacks.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,220
The females in horses are referred to as

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,080
mares where in donkeys they're referred to
as jennies.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,130
Now any stallion or jack that has been
castrated, they're known

22
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,720
as geldings, or specifically in donkeys,
they'll be known as cut-jacks.

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,800
And then a foal is a foal, is a foal

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,050
so that's, that's, that's similar between
you know, horses and donkeys.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,810
Now the first donkey actually originated
from Ethiopia, and

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,940
you can see it's also known as an
Ethiopian donkey.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,840
And you can really see you know, how that
donkey looks so closely resembles

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,380
a Nubian wild ass, and a Somali wild ass
with the striping along the shoulder.

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,760
And, some of that faded striping along the
legs.

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,545
So, you can definitely go, oh yeah, you

31
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,400
can kind of see where that animal came
from.

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,396
And then the Anatolia donkey, it
originated in Turkey, so it's, it's you

33
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:50,690
know, obviously the other side of

34
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,966
the Mediterranean from Ethiopia or further
north.

35
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:56,010
And I, you know, chose this picture to put

36
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,070
in here to, to make you realize that
donkeys

37
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,300
are still used throughout the world, you
know, for

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,780
agriculture and other purposes, so they
are still working animals.

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,324
You know, here's some children bringing in
a harvest with their donkey and when I,

40
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:12,228
when I spent some time in Egypt you know,
I was able to see donkeys pulling

41
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:14,276
carts and you know, still working and

42
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:17,476
they're, and they're very important to
those societies

43
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:19,268
so you know, s, still need to see

44
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:22,540
them have such an important connection to
humans.

45
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,880
Now the next breed we'll talk about is the

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,290
Standard donkey, and this comes really in
three different sizes,

47
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,480
and you can see the the size requirements
or

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,710
where they fit in there in inches and in
centimeters.

49
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,020
So, there's the small standard, the
standard, and the

50
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,330
large standard, and these can be all
different coat colors.

51
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,060
You know, which again next week, we'll,

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,920
we'll, we'll jump into different coat
colors.

53
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,560
Get you up on that.

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,160
Now the next breed is, and I thought it is
a really

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,740
cool one to, to put in here is the Mammoth
Jack donkey.

56
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,570
And this is the largest donkey breed in

57
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,260
the world, and they actually have height
restrictions.

58
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,130
You actually have to be taller than, than
those restrictions.

59
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,030
So for jacks it's 14 hands, for jennies
it's 13.2 hands.

60
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,840
So to register with them, you actually
have to

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,590
be, your donkey has to actually be taller
than that.

62
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,100
And the largest donkey in the world is
named Romulus and he actually stands 17

63
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,170
hands tall, so you know, as tall as

64
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,370
some largest draft horses Romulus, the
Mammoth Jack.

65
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,170
And then the Mary donkey you could

66
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,520
see what, you know, some other [INAUDIBLE]
whether

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,100
the people called the Merv and, and what
not that, and it originated in Iran

68
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,450
and Azerbaijan, so again, you can see some
of that you know, striping from a

69
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,770
Nubian wild ass, and there's probably some
Asiatic

70
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,850
wild ass in there somewhere along the
line.

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,650
And then the next one that a lot of people

72
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,220
love seeing are the Miniature donkeys, and
these originated in

73
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,920
the Mediterranean, and the term burro, You
know, really came

74
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,700
from the Americas, and that's what we call
small donkeys.

75
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,730
So these miniature donkeys, or smaller
donkeys of ours,

76
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,080
you know they're, they're kind of known as
burros.

77
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,640
And, for the Miniature donkeys, you know
they can't be taller than

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,150
nine hands, so they do have some height
restrictions with, with them.

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,960
And then the final breed we'll, we'll talk
about

80
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,390
is the, the p, the Poitou, Poitou donkey
from France.

81
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,670
And what's really cool about these donkeys
is, not only are they tall, so you

82
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,560
can see the long legs on that one, but you
can look at the coat.

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,260
I mean, it's really neat looking.

84
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,540
You know, animal has this really long
hair.

85
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,150
Just really looks, looks cool.

86
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,780
So I, I thought it would be fun to
highlight that one.

87
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,930
But again, similar to horses there's many,
many donkey breeds throughout the world.

88
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,160
You know, I didn't want to leave anybody
out but,

89
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,010
you know, don't have time to cover them
all so.

90
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,490
Still great animals to work with.

91
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,325
Now the next lecture, we're going to, you
know, kind of close out the week,

92
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,178
talking about the hybrids, and how do we
come about with these hybrids.

93
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:48,303
And, and so I look forward to seeing you
then.

94
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:58,303
