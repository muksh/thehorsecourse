1
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:08,327
So welcome back, and in this lecture we're
going to talk about breeds of horses and

2
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:11,080
you may notice something
a little different and, and

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,280
that's the facial hair right.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,270
So, what this is,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,560
is, is a re recording of a lecture
that I gave the last time we ran it.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,150
And we decided, you know, there's
a couple of errors in there, and, and

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,590
one of the most glaring, and I still
love telling this story is, in there,

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,810
when Trish and I start talking about
ponies, I have in there, Icelandic Pony.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,960
And, something I learned
from doing this class.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,570
Is you never call
an Icelandic horse a pony.

11
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,424
Because they will take offense and they'll
let you know and, and actually we had a,

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,956
a really good time on the message
boards laughing about that.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,820
So, you know, we, we decided to re-record
the lecture so this is actually almost

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,996
a year later from all the other lectures
and so overtime I grew a beard and,

15
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:53,606
you know, you let me know on the message
boards if you like it or not.

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,640
But hopefully it's not too distracting for
you,

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,100
and you can still, enjoy this material.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,725
So, in this lecture, we're, we're,
we're really focusing on horse breeds, and

19
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:04,490
you can read the definition there.

20
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,871
It's important to remember, to,
to qualify for a breed, you know,

21
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:13,661
this is a, a, a strain of animals that you
can, you know, their genetics are uniform,

22
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,721
and they pass on from
generation to generation.

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,770
Now horses, obviously, you know, thousands
of years ago when they evolved and

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,750
were domesticated, you know,
they were used for primarily riding.

25
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,008
And then they needed horses to say, pull
a cart, or, as in our agriculture, in our

26
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:37,169
own history, got more advanced, you know,
we needed a horse to, to plow a field.

27
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,710
Or some of the donkeys that, you know,
were, were used as pack animals.

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,315
So back then and, and
it's even going on today.

29
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:49,726
People started to, to breen,
breed certain strains of horses and

30
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:52,528
they developed these horse breeds.

31
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:53,917
So that's why we have so many today.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,260
Now you can see, you know,
this is a group that is very

33
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,741
distinguishable from each other and
these are characteristics that carry on

34
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:06,141
from generation to
generation to generation.

35
00:02:07,322 --> 00:02:11,348
So with breeds comes breed registries.

36
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,291
And there's many, many breed registries
throughout the United States,

37
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,231
throughout the world.

38
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,004
That are specific to that breed of horse.

39
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:21,655
Now, breed registries serve a very,
very important purpose.

40
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:28,234
They, they also ensure that the breed
stays true to its genetics.

41
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:32,018
And they keep pedigrees and, and
records of all these animals.

42
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,744
So, a lot of times,
many of these horse breeds and

43
00:02:35,744 --> 00:02:40,853
breed registries, help, you know,
enhance the value of an animal.

44
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:46,215
And help track, you know, the lineages of,
of your animals and also performance.

45
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:48,959
So, things like performance records,
stuff like that.

46
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,556
Now, sometimes you'll hear this term grade
horse, and what that means is you have a,

47
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:57,891
an animal that's kind of mixed
parentage or mixed breeding, so

48
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:02,029
they can't really be registered with,
say, the quarter horse association,

49
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:06,043
because it may have some quarter horse,
and it may have some standard bred and

50
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:08,056
maybe, you know, some morgan in it.

51
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,680
And it, and
it's a mixture of these breeds.

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,320
So it's not true to, to one single breed.

53
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,330
And they're called grade horses.

54
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:22,880
Now, generally grade horses aren't always
worth as much as a registered horse.

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,550
That's not always true.

56
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,360
But, but, you know, often times not it is.

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
Now there's over 175, probably over
180 breeds throughout the world.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,620
There, there's more being
developed all the time.

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,210
And there's actually some horse
breeds that, you know, are very rare.

60
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,120
And there are some folks throughout
the world that are fighting to

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
try to save these breeds.

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,400
I know there's a,
there's a couple in Europe.

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,880
But you can look at this
website from Oklahoma State.

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,830
Probably has the best comprehensive list
of horse breeds that I have found and

65
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,500
you can go through there and you can see
how many different breeds there are,

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,600
where they're from and

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,540
kind of their history a little bit,
so it's kind of a cool website.

68
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,713
We obviously are not going to have time
to cover all 175, so I'm just going to

69
00:04:03,713 --> 00:04:07,569
highlight some for you and
kind of talk to you about the differences.

70
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,950
Now breeds are generally broken down
into four classification body types.

71
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,090
And they go from Light Horse to
Warmbloods, Heavy Horse, and Ponys.

72
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,920
Now your light horses and
your Warmbloods, very similar body types.

73
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,000
Some people consider Light Horses and
Warmbloods the same thing.

74
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,930
Other people don't.

75
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,480
So just to help you, in this lecture,
I, I divided them out.

76
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,430
But our light horses tend to be our
horses that we consider hot blooded.

77
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,420
Or you know they, they have Thoroughbred,

78
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,660
Arabian, that's where
they originated from.

79
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,050
You know Arabians and Thoroughbreds are
really the, the true hot blooded horses.

80
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,930
Now when I say hot blood what I mean is,

81
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,302
it's not the actual temperature that of
the blood running through their veins.

82
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:54,930
It's actually their disposition.

83
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,530
So somebody says,

84
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,370
oh that horse is a little bit hot blooded,
meaning they're a little bit,

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,250
you know, uptight, you know, a little bit,
you know, high strung type of animal.

86
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,600
And so that's where that,
that hot blooded came from.

87
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,090
Now the sport horse breeds
are generally considered warm bloods,

88
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,560
not quite as, say, flighty as a hot blood.

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,040
But not quite as domesticated or, or
docile, let's say, as our heavy horses,

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,930
our, our cold blood.

91
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,010
Cold blood again has nothing
to do with temperature.

92
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,750
It actually has to do
with their temperament.

93
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,570
And, and the draft horses,
if you've ever been around them,

94
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,240
are just fantastic animals.

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,750
They are just.

96
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,400
They're big puppy dogs.

97
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,340
They, they are really
wonderful to work with.

98
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,030
As big as they are,
I just, the gentle giants.

99
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,200
Wonderful horses.

100
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,480
And, and
that's why we consider them cold blooded.

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,240
Because they're, they're kind of docile.

102
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,900
And then I, you know,
I call them ankle biters.

103
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,650
The ponies.
They're, they're also wonderful, too.

104
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,950
So we'll kind of go through give you
some different examples of breeds.

105
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,730
That fit into those categories.

106
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,230
Okay before we jump into, you know, giving
you some examples of the different breeds,

107
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,250
I, I really want to
discuss with you first on,

108
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,180
on what a hand means in
the equine industry.

109
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,520
A lot of times you'll hear this and
they'll say, oh, that horse stands,

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,070
you know, 15 hands tall, or
that horse is 16 two hands.

111
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,920
So what does that really mean?

112
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,120
Well, a hand is actually a measurement
of four inches or over 10 centimeters.

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,460
So, going up from the base
of the ground to the top

114
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,130
of the withers is how we
measure a horse's height.

115
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,835
And then if say, a horse is 15 hands,
so let me give you an example.

116
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:29,335
15.

117
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,680
And I multiply that by 4 inches.

118
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,970
That would equal 60 inches tall.

119
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,230
Okay.

120
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,450
So 15 times 4 is 60 inches tall.

121
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:44,120
Or you can convert that into centimeters.

122
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,599
Now if I said a horse,
let's say he was 15, 2.

123
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,427
Okay, or you'll hear 15 1, 15 2, or 15 3.

124
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:52,770
We will not say 15 4 because 15
4 would just mean it's 16 hands.

125
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,579
So for each 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3,

126
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:03,280
that's actually how many inches we,
we add.

127
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,440
So, with 60 we're just
going to add 2 inches.

128
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,290
And that horse, that's 15 2,
would stand 62 inches tall.

129
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,920
So, you know, something you're, you, you
hear quite a bit in the the horse industry

130
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,520
no need to erase it, just leave it there,
is, is hands, so in this lecture,

131
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,800
you know, we'll talk about hands.

132
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,320
And as you can see here in
the light horse breeds.

133
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:35,200
Here we talk about horses that
generally stand 14 two up to 16 hands.

134
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,850
Now anything under 14 two
is considered a pony.

135
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,580
So the light horses is above that.

136
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,054
And 16 hands is an average,
I mean I've seen, you know.

137
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:46,280
Quarter horses way above 16 hands,
so that's just a general rule.

138
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,140
And you can see the weight you know
around a thousand pounds on average,

139
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,180
about 1100 pounds on average or
you know 500 kilograms.

140
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,470
And these horses are primarily used for
riding, so the light horse breeds.

141
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,370
But you do find them actually pulling
carts, especially you know a hundred

142
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,660
years ago, before automobiles
became a real big thing.

143
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,700
Or you know, doing some farm work.

144
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,000
Some of these light horses can definitely
do farm work, pull plows and, and

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,970
they still are used throughout the world
in some places, you know, for farm work.

146
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,730
You know, and especially in the United
States we still use quarter horses and

147
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:21,260
others for a lot of our ranching
work that, that folks do.

148
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,180
Now to start with, you know,
you have to start with the Arabian and

149
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,680
the light horse breeds.

150
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,550
This is really the foundational breed for,
for, many, many other breeds, that

151
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,800
you're going to see here in this lecture
and, and others that we won't talk about.

152
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,370
But the Arabian, you know,
really is one that, that we can point to,

153
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,070
has, has a lot of influence
in a lot of modern breeds.

154
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,430
So, you know obviously you
have to talk about them.

155
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,390
And anybody that's
worked around Arabian's,

156
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,980
I mean, beautiful, beautiful animals.

157
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,000
Very high spirited.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,130
Fun to be around.

159
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,530
You know, my students and other people
that I have talked to that have been

160
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,080
around Arabian's, and
I've worked with a few Arabian's.

161
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,130
Just love these animals.

162
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,860
They're just, they're just
wonderful animals to work with.

163
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,950
You can see they're, they're really,
you know, got some neat characteristics.

164
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,525
We, we talk about this dished face
that they have and, you know,

165
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:09,120
kind of an angular head.

166
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,930
You can see the arched neck,
broad chest, stuff like that.

167
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,369
Just a wonder, wonderful animal and
you can see why people love them and, and

168
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:20,030
they're still populous
throughout the world, really.

169
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,360
As a favorite horse.
Now going on, you know,

170
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,000
the Arabian's a foundational breed for
the thoroughbred.

171
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,110
And technically, you know, if you if
you really look at a foundational

172
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,582
breed you can always probably go back
to the Arabian but the thoroughbreds,

173
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:39,840
you know, considered a foundational
breed for many other types of horses and

174
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,738
one we'll talk about next
is the quarter horse.

175
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:45,800
You know where these thoroughbreds once
they bred true, they form their own breed.

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,950
They then form the nucleus of other
breeds, one like is the standard bred too,

177
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,120
you can see a lot of similarities
between thoroughbreds and

178
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,570
standard breds.

179
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,140
So typically, you know, your thoroughbreds
are going to stand taller than 16 hands.

180
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,360
You can definitely see
the Arabian influence in them.

181
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,080
And these are horses that were bred,
you know,

182
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,014
in England to really be endurance horses.

183
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:13,900
These are horses that can run far,
farther than most others.

184
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,525
And so, you know, in,
in thoroughbred racing,

185
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,835
which is a very popular sport
throughout the world, you know,

186
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:22,710
primarily it is thoroughbreds
that you see on the racetrack.

187
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,320
These are horses that can run, you know,
up to a mile and a half in a race.

188
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,900
And really can,
can endure that distance pretty well.

189
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,144
Now the quarter horse,
or the American quarter horse

190
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:38,960
is the most populous breed in
the United States, over 4 million of them.

191
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,202
And really was, was bred, you know, the,
these, these small towns, you know,

192
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:46,880
in the United States,
they wanted a horse that.

193
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,110
You know unlike a thoroughbred
that can run forever,

194
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,900
they wanted a horse that can maybe, you
know, sprint down the street in a race.

195
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,860
So they started to develop this sprinters
type horse or this quarter horse,

196
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,890
quarter mile horse, that could,
that could sprint really quickly.

197
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,740
So in the United States one of our,

198
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,080
our racing venues as American quarter
horses and, you know, if you ever do go.

199
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Don't expect them to run
a mile like a thoroughbred.

200
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,000
They actually run, you know,

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,220
a much shorter distances because
they're known for their sprinter speed.

202
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,860
These horses also have what we call a cow
sense, so, you know, in the old west,

203
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,870
here in the United States,
you always think of the cowboy on

204
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,942
the back of a quarter horse, you know,
riding around, you know, sorting cows.

205
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:32,430
And, and doing other things, and these
animals are very smart, and able to pick

206
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,852
cows out of a herd and stuff like that,
and I will say, I, Iove quarter horses.

207
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:41,660
They're some of my favorite breed to work
with, they're very gentle, you know, and

208
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,760
you can read some of the other
characteristics of them.

209
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,410
So, they're really wonderful,
wonderful animals to own, and, to ride.

210
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,390
Now you can see some of
the other light horse breeds.

211
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,560
And, and the two that I really want,
that stand out that I wanted to highlight,

212
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,410
is a saddlebred, and a standardbred.

213
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,800
And sometimes people get
confused between the two.

214
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,230
Because the, you know,
the names sound do familiar.

215
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,190
Now when you think of a saddlebred,
always think of saddle,

216
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,530
riding and to you that should
say this is a gated horse,

217
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,020
this is a horse that has flashy gates that
goes to shows, as you can see in that

218
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,438
top image, where that,
that gentleman's riding a saddle bred.

219
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:26,280
Now a standardbred is the type
of animal that was actually,

220
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,620
that's used in harness racing.

221
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,050
And they're, they're called
Standardbreds because it used to be

222
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,640
that you had to trot a mile in
two minutes and 30 seconds to,

223
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,910
to meet the standards to be able to
register with that breed registry.

224
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,860
Now that doesn't hold true any more today,

225
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,400
but in their history
that's where it came from.

226
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,330
Now you can see some of
the other light horse breeds.

227
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,180
I three Palomino in there because you
wouldn't think of Palomino as its own

228
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,170
breed but there is a, a Palomino breed
registry here in the United States that's

229
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,210
strictly just based on their color,
much kind of like the Paint Horse,

230
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,390
even though they still have to be,
you know, a light horse body type.

231
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,330
So, you know, just be aware of that.

232
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,276
Now to talk about, you know, probably
some of our audiences favorite horses and

233
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:16,360
the warm bloods and
the sport horse bloodlines.

234
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,860
Wonderful horses to watch compete.

235
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,730
I mean, just beautiful animals.

236
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,010
Very, very similar to
a light horse body type.

237
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,760
You can see the, the weight and

238
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,780
the, the height very,
very similar maybe a little bit taller.

239
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,150
Than some of our light horses and just
to highlight a couple of these breeds.

240
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,300
Hanoverian originated in Germany,

241
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,730
these are types of horses that you
generally if you watch the Olympics and,

242
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,000
and equestrian events these
are the type of horses that you see.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,740
Again one of the oldest warm bloods, very,
very beautiful animal,

244
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,280
the trakehner, again another one that
originated in Germany.

245
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,904
These are the horses you
usually see in dressage.

246
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:57,017
Doesn't mean, you know all
dressage horses are trakehners,

247
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,894
I've actually seen Frisians and,
and other, you know,

248
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:01,560
thoroughbreds, quarterhorses,
all do dressage.

249
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,480
But, you know, some of your, your
high-end dressage animals are trakehners.

250
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,500
And then you can see some
of the other warm bloods.

251
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,330
And you know just in their names
Oldenburg, Bavarian Warmblood.

252
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,610
You can, you can tell these are animals
that, that originated in Europe.

253
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,540
Doesn't mean all the warm bloods
originated in Europe but,

254
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,272
but the vast majority of them have.

255
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:26,980
And just wonderful animals you
know beautiful sport horses.

256
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,900
Now the cold blooded, the drafts.

257
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,710
And I've already kind of talked about,
you know, the puppy dogs.

258
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,120
These are our big horses.

259
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,340
Our, our, our huge ones that you know,
really were developed for farm work.

260
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,620
People do ride them.

261
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,580
You can ride them.

262
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,120
But again, they, they were meant to,
to pull plows and, and carts and, and,

263
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,560
and heavy stuff like that.

264
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,330
So that's why they were built so heavy.

265
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,880
And just wonderful dispositions,
just wonderful animals.

266
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,137
Now, let's talk about different breeds.

267
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:58,390
The first one that I'd like
to share is the Shire.

268
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:03,030
So this is really recognized as
the largest horse breed in the world.

269
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,560
From England.
And then you see this thing

270
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,150
called feathering.

271
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,750
So you, it's typical to see in,
in some of our draft breeds.

272
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,914
You can see this long hair,
you know under the hocks and

273
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,230
the knees and that's called feathering.

274
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,370
So you can see that with our draft horses,
and again you know these these were

275
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,010
horses that originate really from northern
Europe, so in that colder climate.

276
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,740
You know, probably evolved with those, you
know, they were bred to, to have some of

277
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,670
that protection around their lower limbs
to protect it from frostbite and stuff.

278
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,270
Now another very popular one that you see
is the Belgian, and it's from Belgium.

279
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,330
So really kind of known for its sorrel.

280
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,640
You know coat color,
that flaxen tay, tail and mane,

281
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,380
again has some feathering
around those, those lower legs.

282
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,588
I've actually worked with a couple of
Belgian horses who were wonderful, wonderful animals.

283
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,490
The Percheron I included here because,

284
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,660
my goodness, if you want to see a horse
with a lot of muscle and a huge neck,.

285
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,200
Go look at a Percheron I mean that neck
is enormous and you could imagine,

286
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,550
you know, bred these animals to have that
huge neck so they can hold, you know,

287
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,730
that collar when they,
when they pulled these heavy loads.

288
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,370
The Percheron I saw it was like oh my
goodness it, it really kind of, you know,

289
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,320
just enormous, enormous animal.

290
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,310
Usually grey to black in color and then.

291
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,320
You know, they really don't have
feathering on the, on their legs, you,

292
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,150
you know, maybe a little bit but,
but really not known for that.

293
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,160
And then you can see some other,
the other draft horses.

294
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,120
And here in the United States
the Clydesdale is pretty well-recognized.

295
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,410
Friesian's kind of considered
a light-draft horse.

296
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,450
So, there, there are others throughout
the world, that you can look up.

297
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,030
And then finally the ankle biters.

298
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,380
The fun horses, they, they're great
you know, just funny to watch and

299
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,168
fun to work with and children tend to,
to ride them so it's a really great.

300
00:16:57,168 --> 00:17:01,030
Again like I said anything under 14 2
is considered a pony.

301
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,090
And just to highlight a couple breeds.

302
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,000
First one, Shetland. Pretty popular breed.

303
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,230
You know, it's from the, you know,
Shetland Islands around the Arctic Circle.

304
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,900
This one.
Maximum height is 11 2.

305
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,690
So, you know, relatively short.

306
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,430
The Welsh pony is generally
considered good for kids.

307
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,980
But I've seen some people say,
you know, it's like any horse.

308
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,840
It, you know.

309
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,710
They all have different personalities.

310
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,660
So, you know,

311
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,710
there's, I'm sure there's some Welsh
ponies out there that aren't very nice.

312
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,950
But generally, these are,
these have good dispositions.

313
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,860
You know, again, you can see the,
the maximum height, 13 2.

314
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,690
And, that picture's pretty wonderful to,
to, to see.

315
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,920
Jumping, and then the other pony
breeds you can see, you know.

316
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,190
Here in, here in the America's we have
this really, fun, paint, you know,

317
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,650
horse type breed or, or painted body
coat and that's Pony of the Americas and

318
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,850
really, you see these and you think
about the old west and, you know,

319
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,510
American Indians riding horses, you tend
you think of paint horses or paint ponies.

320
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,300
You know, so when I see those Pony,
Pony of the Americas you know,

321
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,460
my imagination runs with that.

322
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,470
The minis, the really really tiny ones.

323
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,530
They, hilarious, I think they're great.

324
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,050
Icelandic horse, it's not a pony.

325
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,420
I just put it there so,
to, to make that clear.

326
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,320
It, it, it is shorter, but it's a horse.

327
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,770
And then the Tibetan pony and then,
obviously there's many others.

328
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,720
So, in the next lecture we're going to
kind of jump into some of the different

329
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,570
breeds of donkeys and asses.

330
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,040
You know, there's many many
of them throughout the world.

331
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,850
So I look forward to seeing you then.

332
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:37,068
Okay, and
then just one more thing to these credits,

333
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,880
these are photo credits,
these aren't the references that I use.

334
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,876
So, you can go online, on the message
board to see all the different references

335
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:47,093
that I've used to reference some
of these breeds and then also,

336
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,898
the other materials of the course.
