1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,320
Welcome to the thousands of students from
over

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,370
130 different countries that are
registered for this class.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,660
It makes me so excited to be able to
present

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,170
this information to so many people from
around the world.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,030
I'm Dr. Chris Mortensen, and this is the
welcome video

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,930
to the, the welcome video to the horse
course and.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,633
Here I am standing in the Florida museum
of Natural History,

8
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:23,100
here on the UF campus and it's just an
amazing place.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,140
That and, and we're so fortunate to be
able to have this on campus.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,290
And I thought, what a perfect setting for
the first week of the course.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,740
Especially as we talk about the history
and evolution

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,650
of horses and donkeys and zebras and the
other equids.

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,150
Behind me is a if you don't recognize it,
that's a Columbian mammoth.

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,250
And, and it was found in North America and
they went extinct about 10,000 years ago.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,540
And that's about when horses were ejected
from

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,100
North America as you'll find out this
week.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,210
So the purpose really of this video is to
kind of talk

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,050
about the course, the syllabus kind of go
over some of the objectives.

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,310
You'll know each week we, you're going to
notice

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,500
there's about 60 to 90 minutes worth of
video.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,360
Some of the videos go longer than 15
minutes, and, and

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,888
generally those are, are, lectures that
are really, really important information.

23
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:15,896
Not to say not all of it is, but that's
tend to, that's why they tended to go

24
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:17,400
a little bit longer, and I chose not to

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,590
reshoot them because you know, that's
very, very important information.

26
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,380
So watch those videos at your leisure, and
then if you're, you're interested in

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,648
earning a statement of accomplishment or a

28
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:31,861
statement of accomplishment with
distinction, you will be

29
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:35,830
asked to, to take each weekly quiz, which
is only ten, it's ten points,

30
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,602
ten questions, multiple choice, so not, I,

31
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:42,030
not purposely built to be very, very
rigorous.

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,490
And then beginning next week, we're going
to ask you to start

33
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,010
turning in weekly assignments and there's
four weekly assignments and the goal of

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,830
you know, creating those assignments is
for you to apply the information

35
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,480
that's presented to you in the, in the
lectures to an actual animal.

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,050
So either one you own or a hypothetical
animal.

37
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,160
But the idea is to get you thinking about
the management and the

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,060
information presented to you and applying
that to, to horse or donkey care.

39
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,950
So also we're going to ask that you
evaluate three of

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,830
your peers if you do turn in your, your
weekly assignment.

41
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,740
And you have to really think about it
with,

42
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,090
with thousands and thousands of students
from around the world.

43
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,700
That's the only feasible way we can grade
or evaluate

44
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,020
your work is, is through peer eval, so, I
know

45
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,920
through some other Coursera courses is not
the most popular

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,020
option, but really that's the only way we
can do it.

47
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,190
But I'll be, you know, obviously
throughout the course, I'll be monitoring

48
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,040
that and, and, and making sure people are
fair to each other.

49
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,520
So, in addition to you know, quizzes and
weekly assignments.

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,710
We also, we are also going to provide
weekly

51
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,490
gaming activities to help prepare you for
the quizzes.

52
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,980
I’ve gone in and, and created some, some
online games and

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,760
some app games that you can actually do on
your own.

54
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,830
That’s going to reinforce the material.

55
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,070
They should be fun, you know some of them
are like battleship or jeopardy or.

56
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,455
Some you know, Who Wants to be a
Millionaire type

57
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,370
games that you have to answer questions
relating to the course.

58
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,760
So those will be provided to you, you
know, to, to, to practice and to have

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,840
fun with, and then also I highly, highly

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,780
encourage you to participate in the
discussion boards.

61
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,070
You know, get to know your other students
I mean we have people from all over the

62
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,060
world so you know, obviously people down
in Australia

63
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,460
or in Asia or in Africa or South America.

64
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,440
You know, we all manage horses a little
bit

65
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,190
differently or donkeys a little bit
differently, so share

66
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,610
your experiences you know, what works for
you, and

67
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,360
all I ask is that you're respectful for
everybody's opinions.

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,290
You know, be, be respectful to each other
on the discussion boards.

69
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,390
Now, I'm going to monitor the class,
throughout the next six weeks,

70
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,490
and I'll be checking in with you with a
video, you

71
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,990
know, each week, you know, kind of
addressing some of the

72
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,100
hot button issues that, that people
brought up in the discussion boards.

73
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,790
And, kind of introduce you to that week's
material.

74
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,830
So, so I really look forward to this
class, I'm so

75
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,750
excited to, to get going and I'll, I'll
see you next week.
