1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,090
All right, welcome back and in this
lecture

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,300
we are going to kind of explore how horses
have

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,420
made such as impact on us and, and in

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,170
this slide it's one of my favorite cave
drawings.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,040
You know, obviously cause I have such a
passion for horses and

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,550
this is from the Chauvet Cave in France,
and if you've never seen

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,670
it I, you know, you can go online and they
have a really

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,350
neat really neat section on all the, the
cave artwork that they've found.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,860
And you know, it dates back thousands and
thousands of years.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,930
So you know, horses, obviously have played
a huge role in my promo video.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,600
And I'll say it again and again and again.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,730
Horses are man's true best friend.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,710
I love dogs.

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,650
Dogs are awesome, you know?

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,480
There's nothing like a, a dog wet kiss,
right?

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,530
But horses have been with us every step of
the way

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,890
as we have evolved and explored this
planet and as we've

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,890
grown horses have been critical in each
stage of you know,

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,370
each major stage of our development in the
last few thousand years.

20
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,530
Now early on horses were hunted for food
so you know, it

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,320
was just another animal that early man was
hunting these these animals.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,870
And it's important to remember that horse
meat is

23
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,360
still eaten, you know, many parts of the
world today.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,230
So, you know, in, in Mexico, Japan,
Europe, other countries.

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,760
You know, it, it is a part of their diet,
and we, we have to

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,810
respect that, you know, even though here
in

27
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,639
the United States we, we don't eat horses.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,300
Now this picture, you may, why is this
important?

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,960
And, I just kind of threw it up there to

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,540
show you, you know, science and the cool
thing about science.

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,170
But also, you know, how we've been able
through

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,730
cha, DNA evidence, been able to trace the
migratory

33
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,490
route of humans, and as you can see we

34
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,186
all go back to common ancestors in Eastern
Africa.

35
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:51,990
And men and women have migrated into
Europe, migrated across Asia, came

36
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,920
down into the Americas to where the South
American Indians are actually the most

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,470
divergent through genetics, from our most
common ancestor.

38
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,690
And I put this up here because this is how
we're really unlocking

39
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,860
a lot of mysteries in a lot of species
through DNA evidence and

40
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,260
people are actually looking at this now,
currently in horses, to kind of

41
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,380
figure out, you know, where these

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,580
horses were domesticated because nobody
really knows.

43
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,200
We don't have firm, firm evidence, but
maybe through some DNA, you know DNA

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,000
testing, and we can start developing a

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,520
more clearer picture of where this
happened.

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,270
So you know, I'm just going to cover three
main areas where people

47
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,720
think horses might have first, you know,
been domesticated over 6000 years ago.

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,490
And the first one is in modern day
Ukraine.

49
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,020
There is some evidence that possibly
horses

50
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,300
were first roped and you know somebody
jumped

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,905
on the back of them and thought wow this
is fun or this is really great.

52
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,790
Let's do this some more.

53
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,810
So that's one area that people think it
might be and then there are some

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,170
evidence that it might have been in China
or Mongolia around the same time period.

55
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,350
You know, possibly this is where horses
were

56
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,700
and then this paper from, from the Levine
that

57
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,740
came out in the, the Equine Vet Journal,
it

58
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,070
proposes the best evidence is actually in
Northern Kazakhstan.

59
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,850
You know, looking at some of the old bones
of

60
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,570
the horses that they found, looking at the
male female ratios.

61
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,120
You know, he was saying in his article
that it was a one to one ratio.

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,330
Where in some of these other pastoral
societies, you know, when

63
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,150
they were hunting horses, you know, you
would find, you know, mainly

64
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,490
younger horses or more females and less
males because that's how

65
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,920
horses naturally are, one male to a few
females and their band.

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,420
So it was an interesting paper, and, and,
and really

67
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,788
some compelling evidence that this is
where horses were first domesticated.

68
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:51,310
But, the take-home message is it was
somewhere in this Eurasia area, on the

69
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,490
plains of Asia and Eastern Europe, where

70
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,040
horses were first thought to be
domesticated.

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,250
Now, why should we domesticate these
animals?

72
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,570
And the obvious answer is it's fun, but
you can jump on the back of them.

73
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,800
You can go a lot faster than we can run.

74
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
You can go further.

75
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,030
And, you know, early on this probably
gave, you know, these early hunters a

76
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,840
huge advantage, you know, being able to
run down prey and, and get them.

77
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,875
And then here's an earlier, you know,
another cave drawing, you know, over

78
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,819
5,000 years ago showing, you know, a man
on the back of a horse.

79
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,030
And as, you know, we, we get more
developed you

80
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,770
know, there's more evidence of horses
being used in different ways.

81
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,280
You know, pulling chariots, starting to
see them

82
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,190
in agriculture, yet they were, they were
still

83
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,590
being raised in many parts of the world as
meat, but also, you know, Beast of Burden.

84
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,300
You know, pulling carts, pulling chariots,
stuff like that.

85
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,920
And they really make a, a huge impact
during the Bronze

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,230
Age, so were looking at you know, 3000 to
1000 BCE.

87
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,660
Ane you know, again talking about
travelling distances,

88
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,310
better agriculture but also you know,
increasing trade.

89
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,620
All of this resulting in better nutrition,

90
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,690
you know, more advance society, larger
families,

91
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,510
so again horses are allowing us to have
more people as advance a lot quicker.

92
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,130
So what other species on earth has done
that and there isn't,

93
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,360
horses are it, they are, they are the most
important in our development.

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,580
And then again to see, you know, how early
man felt

95
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,080
about these animals, we find that all, all
in their artwork.

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,120
This is White Horse Hill in England.

97
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,930
The White Horse of Uffington.

98
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,860
And you can see that it's clearly a
picture, and

99
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,299
it, it's, you know, this chalked outline
of a horse.

100
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,960
Now, just a couple other interesting
tidbits, the first

101
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,800
evidence of use of saddles was the
Assyrian calvalry.

102
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
And here you can see in this picture, you
know, showing,

103
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,500
showing that in, you know a soft pad or
blanket type.

104
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,810
Doesn't have stirrups, so, you know, get
incredible horsemen back

105
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,890
then and women, that they could ride these
animals almost bareback.

106
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,370
You know, now they started using blankets,
soft pads, then the wooden

107
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,600
saddles started to be developed, the
framed saddles that we see today.

108
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,620
And then the first evidence of stirrups
actually dates to India.

109
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,930
And it actually goes to these loop rope

110
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,610
stirrups that they would put their toes
in.

111
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,070
So that's, you know, those were the early
stirrups.

112
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,920
And then the metal stirrups started
developing later.

113
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,450
And I think China and then parts of

114
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,290
Europe really started to flourish with the
stirrups.

115
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,400
Now, the horse for thousands of years was,
you

116
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,130
know, critical to our own development, our
daily lives.

117
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,950
Everybody pretty much had some sort of
equid, whether it was

118
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,240
a donkey or a horse or mule or some other
hybrid.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,520
And, you use that to transport, you know,
get around, go to the neighbor's house.

120
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,950
Do the things that you did in your daily
life.

121
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,680
That all changed in the 20th century and
really

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,060
the automobile was the major thing that
changed it.

123
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,030
And it you know, I use the United States
as kind of

124
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,540
a, you know, microcosm of what was
probably going on globally, too.

125
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,870
And the, the horse population was about 26
million in 1915.

126
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,200
And then after World War I, with the
Calvary

127
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,090
being really ineffective, and automobiles,
you know, making more and

128
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,590
more of a presence known, horses really
started to

129
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,430
in popularity declined toward the 1960,
you know by 1960.

130
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,290
There was maybe 3 million left in the
United States.

131
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,250
So, it's a huge, huge decrease.

132
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,300
Now we know after 1960, we start to see
this horse population

133
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,860
increase in the United States, to where we
have over 10 million today.

134
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,200
And I like to say people rediscovered the
horse.

135
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,440
You know?

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,640
They, they, they found these animals.

137
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,700
Fell back in love with them.

138
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,740
Yeah, we have a car.

139
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,130
Yeah, we have a motorcycle or a bicycle or
whatever.

140
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,880
But it's not the same as riding a horse.

141
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,820
There's just something about it, you know?

142
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,650
Being out-, outdoors, riding the back of
an animal.

143
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,910
And that's what a lot of people have
rediscovered.

144
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,550
And so we've seen this in the United
States, really take off.

145
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,540
And in other parts of the world, I mean,
South

146
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,950
America, huge hotbed of horse activity in,
in Asia and Europe.

147
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,560
So you know, we're not alone here in the
United States.

148
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,480
A lot of people have, have rediscovered
their passions for these animals.

149
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,129
And so we're really seeing it, it pick up
the pace.

150
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,090
So in our next lecture, we're going
kind of jump

151
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,780
in and talk about different breeds, you
know, throughout the

152
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,210
world, there's over 140 breeds of, you
know, horses, and,

153
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,670
and then we'll jump into breeds of donkeys
and whatnot.

154
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,870
But, you know, we're not going to be able
to cover all of them.

155
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,510
So, we're going to take some snapshots
here and there and kind of cover

156
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,610
some of the big breeds in the world, and
you know, go from there.
