1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,140
All right, welcome back.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,970
In this next talk, we're going to talk
about the

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,500
evolution of horses, and donkeys, and
zebras, and the other equids.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,420
So, if we look at evolution, you know,
here's the definition, you know,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,290
you're looking at the change in genetics
over, over long periods of time.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,370
This is, this is something that happens,
you know, naturally, relatively

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,300
slowly and as we'll see in, in this
lecture over 55

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,560
million years is how we can trace, how we
can go

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,140
back and trace back to the earliest
relatives of the horse.

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,290
Now we could speed this up a little bit
with,

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,800
you know, natural, or, excuse me,
artificial selection with breeding.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,410
So we do that with modern day breeding.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,820
We can actually speed evolution up.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,800
You know, we can breed for, for better
genetics and do this quicker.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,850
Now obviously, you know, the theory of

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,160
evolution or natural selection dates back
to Darwin.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,850
And the reason I bring this up is because
the

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,800
horse or the equid is really the model
species for evolution.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,460
This is a species that we have more bones
that show changes over

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,440
time than almost any other species that
we've found on Earth to date.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,570
So this is why you now, we always go to
the

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,919
horse as the model, as we'll see in, in
this lecture.

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,600
And you know, again we can trace this
back, these

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,350
changes over time, over 55 million years
where Eohippus the very

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,950
first horse, you know, looks like a small
dog to

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,450
where we get actually our tall, even our
giraffe breeds today.

27
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,469
Our really tall horses.

28
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,360
And, the two, the two parts of the
skeleton

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,970
that really we can, we can point to this,
is

30
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,350
the dramatic changes in toes, and the
lower leg,

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,210
changes in the lower leg, and then also
their teeth.

32
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,499
You know, as their diets changed over
time, their teeth changed with it.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,890
Now here's one of the earlier papers.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,410
There's a whole host of papers that were,
you know, the early twentieth

35
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,760
century when you know, Darwin in the

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,460
nineteenth century proposed his Theory of
Evolution.

37
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,670
Scientists were rushing to find support of
evidence.

38
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,280
And this is where they, they really
started pointing to the

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,710
horse, you know, and can see these, these
changes in the bones.

40
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,200
So here is a paper, here is a nice

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,710
picture taken by this paper published in
1926 by Mathew.

42
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,270
And you can see that, that the Eocene, you
know, as it goes up

43
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,760
to today's modern horse, and it's showing
you the skull and the lower legs.

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,140
And really, the thing that we're going to
notice as this

45
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,690
horse goes from four toes to one toe, to
the hoof today.

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,550
So looking at that, you know, the
eohippus, or Hyracotherium, right

47
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,570
there as you can see, you know, was a
four-toed animal.

48
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,440
And then over time, it went to three toes,
and then

49
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,570
those toes started to migrate up the leg
to one toe.

50
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,160
And you can see that in the bottom
picture, so the top

51
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,860
picture is actually a modern horse, or
equid, you know, zebra, donkey.

52
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,830
That's what their lower legs look like.

53
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,490
And you'll see the, the splint bones
remnant

54
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,940
of the toes that their earlier relatives
had.

55
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,540
So we can, you know, see the evidence,
direct evidence, in our modern day horses.

56
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,950
Now here's a good graph.

57
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,400
You know?

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,980
Obviously, if you go online and Google a
lot of this, or search

59
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,400
for a lot of this, you can find different
images of horse evolution.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,060
But I always like this one, because it
shows the lower leg, and kind of what

61
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,040
the animal would look like over time, or

62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,520
an artist's guess over time in the
phylogenetic tree.

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,020
You know, the changes going from, you
know, earlier to today.

64
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,950
So we're just going to kind of take some
snapshots in here.

65
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,000
You know, we don't have time to go through
obviously every, every layer of this.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,850
So we'll start at the beginning and we've
already talked about Eohippus

67
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,080
and the other name that it's known as is
the Dawn Horse.

68
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,990
And, again, here's what it may look like
with

69
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,670
the striped patterns, they're trying to
take a guess.

70
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,990
You know, this was more of a browser type
animal,

71
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,090
probably ate lots of leaves and small
plants and shrubs.

72
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,210
So, they were made for that.

73
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,910
They were made for little forest regions,
and, and that's

74
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,430
why their toes and they could climb and do
other things.

75
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,610
So, they were relatively short, you know,
20 inches at the shoulder or 50

76
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,390
centimeters and they had four toes on the
front, three toes on the back.

77
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,770
And they only had three grinding molars,
n'kay.

78
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,790
So like they weren't heavy grazers like
our horses today.

79
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,870
So again that's where they think they were

80
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,510
browsers and ate more leaves and small
plants.

81
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,860
Now, if we jump, you know, 15 to 20

82
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,860
million years, we can jump and see the
mesohippus.

83
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,500
And so, this was roughly, you know, they
evolved about 40 million years ago.

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,820
And what's unique about this jump is they
went from four to three toes.

85
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,850
So, this is where we start seeing evidence
of

86
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,040
that, that fourth digit disappearing and
going up the leg

87
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,100
on those earlier equids are, well they're
really not equids

88
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,680
at this point, the earlier species from
eohippus to mesohippus.

89
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,260
And you can see there are not that

90
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,140
much taller, so they're getting a little
bit taller,

91
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,320
but what's also interesting about this is
they

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,510
went from three grinding teeth to six
grinding teeth.

93
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,980
So, obviously some, there are some dietary
changes driving this evolution, where,

94
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,140
you know, they kind evolve more of a, as
they, they evolved

95
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,970
a more grass based diet, their teeth
changed with them so they

96
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,080
can handle that eating constant grass,
grinding it down and eating it.

97
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,470
So, so from that browse diet to more of a
grazing diet.

98
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,250
Now we're going to jump ahead, you know,
pretty far again and

99
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,560
this is where we get to dinohippus, which
is where we

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,780
start seeing evidence of a single-toed
horse, you know, they go

101
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,970
on from those three toes to that one toe
or one hoof.

102
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,710
So that's where we start to see first
evidence.

103
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,560
And this is about 12 million years ago.

104
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,430
So they kind of look like equus which is

105
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,760
the forerunner of today's modern equids
and you can

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,830
see from this, this image here you can
look at the the, the lower leg on this.

107
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,470
And you can still see, you know, just that
hoof.

108
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,030
And then those two two toes are just,
kind of, remnants.

109
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,450
So maybe a little supportive.

110
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,540
Maybe not.

111
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,840
But really they're, they're getting used
to, one toe.

112
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,590
And then, gain, those teeth.

113
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:16,810
You know?

114
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,080
Here you can see those teeth are starting

115
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,790
to be grinders where they're going to
start grinding.

116
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,570
And, you know?

117
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,690
Again as, as their diets changed.

118
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:24,850
You know?

119
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,270
They, their, their lower legs start to
evolve so

120
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,330
that they could get faster and could
outrun predators.

121
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,390
And that's what driving this development
in this species.

122
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,520
Now we're going to jump ahead to Equus.

123
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,730
So, Equus is actually the, the forerunner
for today's donkeys, zebras, and horses.

124
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,620
So, they all trace back to Equus, and so
that's where we

125
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,640
get that, that family name and they
evolved for about 5 million

126
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,460
years ago and they died out about a
million years ago and

127
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,980
these were animals that were found all
over the world except Australia.

128
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,230
Okay so the, what's really surprise about
this

129
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:08,340
slide is horses or equus evolved in North
America.

130
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,810
So that's where we find a lot, all the
bones, all the, all the records are

131
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,340
actually in, in North America and mostly
in

132
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,900
the United States, some in Canada, some in
Mexico.

133
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,430
So you can see about 55, 58 million years
ago that's where Eohippus was evolving and

134
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,640
then 20 million years ago as, as they
evolved they spread out North America.

135
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,490
And then roughly they've, they think about
10 million years ago, and

136
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,820
onward, Equus started to migrate, you
know, throughout the rest of the world.

137
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,050
So it went over this, this land bridge
that's been recognized

138
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,970
between, you know, Siberia and United
States of Alaska that's, you

139
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,250
know, not only did early man come over a
similar land

140
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,660
bridge but horses actually migrated out,
or equus migrated out from there.

141
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,220
And then they spread out throughout Asia

142
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,005
and Europe and then evolved, obviously
equus

143
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:02,920
[UNKNOWN] and equus [UNKNOWN] and then the

144
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,710
zebras also evolved from those early
horses.

145
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,610
What is also interesting, about 10,000
years ago, the horses completely

146
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,520
disappeared from North America and, and
South America and, and Central America.

147
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,390
You couldn't, you couldn't find them
anymore.

148
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,580
And this kind of, you know, coincides
with,

149
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,300
with dying out of some other mega
[UNKNOWN]

150
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,430
such as, you know, the mammoth and the
woolly rhino and some of those others.

151
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,430
So it could have been a change in climate,

152
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,960
you know, with some over hunting, their
food could of

153
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,160
been dwindling so there, scientists aren't
quite clear on,

154
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,270
on what drove them to extinction, out of
the Americas.

155
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,850
But they didn't come back until the
fifteenth or

156
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,240
sixteenth century, the 1500s when the
Spanish came, and

157
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,110
the conquistadors were you know, venturing
through Central, South

158
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,460
and North America, and some horses got
away from them.

159
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,840
And that's where they establish the wild
populations that we see today.

160
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,690
Now the final slide of this presentation
is

161
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,000
that the, the two relatives from horses
and this

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,210
surprises a lot of people it's, it's
pretty

163
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,030
neat and that is the rhinoceros and the
tapir.

164
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,060
Those are the horses two closest relatives
that we can actually trace

165
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,750
them back to that early ancestor there you
can see on the slide.

166
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,690
So, so there are all pretty similar er,
with a rhino and a tapir and a horse.

167
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,079
It's, it's, it's pretty, pretty funny and
pretty neat.

168
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,460
So one thing you can do, you know, in the
United States, there's still some

169
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,820
debate about evolution when, you know,
there's a

170
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,376
lot of evidence pointing to evolution
being fact.

171
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,020
So if, you know, if you want, you can go
in the discussion

172
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,760
board and talk about this further and how
horses support the idea of evolution.

173
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,700
I mean, the evidence is there in the soil.

174
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,780
We can see the changes in the bones.

175
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,660
You know I think it would be an
interesting

176
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,200
discussion to read and then in the next
lecture

177
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,380
we're going to talk about, you know, how
horses have

178
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,105
played a role in, in our own evolution and
development.

179
00:09:57,105 --> 00:10:06,543
