1
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:05,530
All right, welcome back to the second
lecture

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,180
of week two, and this lecture is hoof
anatomy.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,900
And, you know, we devote, you know, the
next three lectures

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,430
really just focusing on the hoof because
it is so critical

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,550
to their care that, you know, it's really
worth while to

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,070
pay attention to these lectures and
hopefully, give you some tips.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,050
So, you know, it's really important to
maintain a horse's hoof.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,750
And, you know, it's really critical to
their ability to move, you know?

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,370
So, if you're competing with this horse or
any type of activity, if

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,120
something's wrong with their feet, they're
not going to be able to go anywhere.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,940
And it's just, it's really critical to
their, to their, you know, health and

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,370
well being, because, the old adage or the
old saying is no hoof, no horse.

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,050
And you know, I'm going to use Barbaro as
an example, and we're

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,400
going to get in much more detail when we
get in the laminitis talk.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,710
You know, Barbaro is a story that happened
in 2006 in the United States.

16
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,040
He had won the Kentucky Derby.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,210
Spectacular horse, people really thought
he was

18
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,930
the next great chance for a triple crown.

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,330
In the initial stretch of the Preakness
Stakes, he breaks his hind right leg.

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,755
And what happened was his hind right leg
healed fine.

21
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:18,760
It's just he started going laminitic in
all the rest of his feet.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,020
And so, that, that's what really led to
his demise.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,440
And he was euthanized in January of 2007.

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,940
So, you know that's what directly caused
him to, to no

25
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,050
longer be able to live, you know, he had
no feet.

26
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,610
Now, looking at anatomy, you know, we're
going to

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,270
start on the outside and work our way in.

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,070
And the first portion is just this outer
hoof portion,

29
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,060
and this is what we call insensitive, or
epidermal, tissue.

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,070
Now, it's insensitive because it doesn't
have the

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,540
nerve structure or really a lot of blood
flowing

32
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,190
in those areas, and I like to, to tell

33
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,520
students that it, it's almost like your
long fingernails.

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,310
You know, we clip our, our long
fingernails

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,930
all the time, and we don't feel anything.

36
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,760
You know, as long as it's the, the dead
portion

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,160
or out, outgrowth portion, which is very
similar to the horse.

38
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,590
So that's why we're able to put on, nail
shoes on,

39
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,227
or, or trim their feet, and they, they
feel no discomfort whatsoever.

40
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:12,040
Now, the bottom of the hoof anatomy is

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,130
really, really important to, to know
different structures.

42
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,110
So, it's worth while to review this slide
in detail.

43
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,490
You know, if you ever get in discussions
with a fairer or your

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,240
veterinarian, you need to know, you know,
what he or she is referencing to.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,970
Now, just looking at the, the external
part, you know, divide the hoof into

46
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:34,690
really three parts, and the first portion
is called the toe.

47
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,750
So you can see here, the next portion is
the quarters.

48
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,690
And then there is this, this final portion
is what we call the heel.

49
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,100
So, we'll say heels, quarters, toe in
reference to that.

50
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,570
And just going around, this right here,
which I'll

51
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,610
highlight in later slides too, is called
the frog.

52
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,880
We'll talk about that.

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,320
You know, here's the bars of the frog in
here.

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,690
Most of this area, you know, is the sole.

55
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,550
So, you're looking at, you know, all the
way

56
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,350
through here is, is really the, the
concave portion of

57
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,930
the hoof, and then this outer portion, or
the hoof

58
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,360
wall, you know, is really going all the
way around.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,510
And we'll talk about that too, especially
when we talk about hoof care,

60
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,280
but that's where the horse rests, or
should be resting, most of their weight.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,030
They shouldn't be resting weight on the
sole or the frog,

62
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,630
that outer wall should really be the part
that's protruding down.

63
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,030
So, and we'll get to that when we talk
about hoof care.

64
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,520
Now, in this slide, I just put up the
bottom of a hoof

65
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,110
and just wanted to see if you could
identify some structures on your own.

66
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,050
So you can pause the video and try to go

67
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,350
back through that, and just compare it to
an actual hoof

68
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,150
on this slide and to the previous one,
with all the

69
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,280
different structures, and see if you can
find them on that.

70
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,790
Now one, one portion I did not talk about
in the previous slide is this

71
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,840
area that you can kind of see starting
right

72
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,780
here, and it goes all the way around.

73
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,690
And that's going to help lead us into,

74
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,050
you know, talking about the internal
structure.

75
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,550
But that's called the white line.

76
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,320
And the white line is where you get you
know,

77
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,040
the the inner hoof wall combining with the
outer hoof wall.

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,590
Now, the coronary band is this region
right here,

79
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,370
which you can see at the top of this hoof.

80
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,690
Okay.

81
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,070
And that's almost like our nail bed.

82
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,400
So, that's where the hoof grows out.

83
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,250
So, starting from there growing down is
where the hoof kind of originates.

84
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,320
So, if we look at our own nail beds, you

85
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,440
know, that's kind of very similar to the
coronary band.

86
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,130
Now, it's important to remember if, if
this gets injured or, you know,

87
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,030
sometimes horses can clip their, their
hooves

88
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,130
when, you know, exercising or what not.

89
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,210
You know, that can slow down or stop
growth.

90
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,970
So you always want to be careful if you do
have a horse that has

91
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,250
an injury there, to have a veterinarian
or, or a fairer look at that area.

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,320
Now, things that can affect hoof growth.

93
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,430
You know, you can see the list there.

94
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,780
And, and the two that I'll highlight is
nutrition.

95
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,310
And we know through research that, you
know,

96
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,550
hoof growth definitely has a, is affected
by nutrition.

97
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,720
And, and what we mean is, horses that have
a higher plane of nutrition or

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,530
they're, they have diets that are just
higher

99
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,980
in nutrients, they're going to have better
hoof growth.

100
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,950
And so, there are a bunch of

101
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,330
supplements in different markets
throughout the world that

102
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,640
sells hoof promotants, and, and you know,
some

103
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,260
of these have research; some of these
don't.

104
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,620
But the general knowledge or the general
rule

105
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,550
of thumb is better nutrients equal better
hoof growth.

106
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,580
And then the other one I'll highlight
really quickly too is the environment.

107
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,270
In dry areas of the world or when it's dry

108
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,890
times of the year, hoof growth is actually
going to slow down.

109
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,540
And then during more wet, you know, spring
season or

110
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,590
rainy season, those hooves are going to
grow a little bit faster.

111
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,470
Now, on average, a horse is going to grow,
the hoof's

112
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,460
going to grow about a quarter to have an
inch per month.

113
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,546
So, it takes anywhere from nine months to
a

114
00:05:55,546 --> 00:06:00,015
year for a horse to fully grow out their
hooves.

115
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:03,525
Now, the other structure I really wanted
to address on the outer

116
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:07,615
hoof wall is this frog region, which you
can see it outlined there.

117
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,180
It's a little off center, but that, that's
on purpose so you can visualize that.

118
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,570
And the frog is the area of the hoof that
is, I guess if

119
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,220
you, if you said anywhere, an area was
sensitive, it would be the frog.

120
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,960
Now, there aren't, there isn't nerves
running through there.

121
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,830
But it's the softer portion of, of the
outer hoof.

122
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,475
So, it's made up of approximately 50%
moisture.

123
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:31,470
And, that's important because it really
helps

124
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,690
the hoof expand when they strike the
ground.

125
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,630
So it's almost the shock absorber.

126
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,840
And it gives that hoof a little bit of its
elasticity.

127
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,100
So, when the horse hits the ground, that

128
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,080
hoof actually kind of presses, compresses
and spreads out.

129
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,670
And that's why, you know, the frog with
that moisture content can kind of do that.

130
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,860
So, and when we get to talking about hoof

131
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,730
care, we'll address the frog a little bit
more,

132
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,050
you know, on, on being careful trimming
the frog,

133
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,090
because you, you can injure it if you
overdo it.

134
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,500
Now, going from the outside to the inside,
you know, the inside

135
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,990
we call the sensitive tissue or the dermal
layer, and you can

136
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,160
see you know, that looks like that's
pretty painful, you know, and

137
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,240
obviously that was a horse that, that was
euthanized at some point.

138
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,850
But you can see the, the rich blood supply
and that, when we

139
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,080
call it sensitive, that also means that
there's a lot of nerves there.

140
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,900
So again, like the bottom of our nailbed.

141
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,820
Anybody's that accidentally clipped their
nails too

142
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,320
short or pulled a nail, it's extremely
painful.

143
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,430
Well, that's because of all the nerves
that are in there

144
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,880
and very similar to a horse's hooves, you
know that internal tissue.

145
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,490
Now, I referenced the white line earlier,
and if you looked at, you know, going

146
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,620
from the external tissue to the internal

147
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,196
tissue, it would be this region right
here.

148
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:49,680
So, you're, you're, you're looking at the
portion where the outer hoof wall

149
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,850
is attaching to the inner hoof, and that's
through the laminar interface.

150
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,590
So, they have these interlocking fingers
that actually

151
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,520
are really tight, even down at the
microscopic level.

152
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,270
And they keep everything in place.

153
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,530
Now, also important with the, the, this
laminar

154
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,360
inter, interface is it attaches to the
coffin bone.

155
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,180
So, it keeps the coffin bone locked in at
the proper

156
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,560
angle, and it just really holds the
entire, the hoof structure together.

157
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,920
Now speaking of bones, these are three
bones that make up the hoof wall.

158
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,260
So we started with the short pastern or we
call it the P2 or second

159
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,190
phalanx, and then we have the navicular
bone

160
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,940
here, and then we have the coffin bone.

161
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,600
So these are the bones that make up the
hoof.

162
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,950
Now, this long pastern bone is actually P1
for the first phalanx.

163
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,300
And so that's really not part of the hoof,
but that's

164
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,410
coming down, you know, from the fetlock
down to the pastern.

165
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,320
Now, I'm only going to talk about two

166
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,190
tendons, and before I do that, understand
that

167
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:01,150
tendons is the portion of the connective
tissue that connects a muscle to a bone.

168
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,180
Whereas, ligaments attach bone to bone.

169
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,830
So, we talk about two really important
tendons that are important in the hoof.

170
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,750
And the first is the deep digital flexor
tendon or the DDFT.

171
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,960
And that attaches to the back of the
coffin bone, here.

172
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,170
So, we're looking right down here and
actually, it's, it's

173
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,020
up here where it attaches to the deep
digital flexor muscle.

174
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,760
Now, when that muscle contracts, so when

175
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,090
we contract the muscle, we actually
shorten it.

176
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,400
Okay.

177
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,530
So, you can imagine that's going to pull
this

178
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,770
tendon up, and this hoof is going to flex.

179
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,540
So it flexes back.

180
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:39,810
Okay.

181
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,300
So it pulls it back.

182
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,790
That's flexing.

183
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,280
And that's from the deep digital flexor
tendon.

184
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,830
Now, the other one is the common digital
extensor tendon.

185
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,430
And so if you imagine up here the common
digital extensor muscle actually

186
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,450
contracts, so it's shortens and pulls up
on this, and so

187
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,260
the hoof is going to extend so extends
out.

188
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,280
And that's how those two tendons work.

189
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,370
Now, there's other tendons running in
there, and

190
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,610
you know, the suspensory ligament and
other things that,

191
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,470
that are in part of the leg anatomy that

192
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,230
are important because horses do get
injuries there, but.

193
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,750
So just be aware that, that there are a
lot of, tendons and ligaments in there,

194
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,050
keeping all the structures together, but
these are

195
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,050
the two that I just wanted to highlight.

196
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,802
And then, the final slide kind of talking
about hoof

197
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:33,066
anatomy, and this will get important
especially when we run

198
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,458
into, start talking about laminitis is
there's a really rich

199
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,082
blood supply running down to the hoof, so
you can

200
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:41,706
see the, the the, you know, the many blood

201
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:45,610
vessels running through there, and it's
really critical, that helps

202
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,194
those tissues, you know, grow and sustain
themselves, and grow

203
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:52,202
the hoof, so, when we get to laminitis,
we'll know,

204
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:56,584
we'll talk about the importance of that a
little bit more in a couple lectures.

205
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:58,653
So next, we're going to jump into hoof
care.

206
00:10:58,653 --> 00:10:59,777
So I'll see you then.

207
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:08,650
