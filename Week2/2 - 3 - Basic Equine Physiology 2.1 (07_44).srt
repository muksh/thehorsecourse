1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,570
Alright.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,750
Welcome to week two of the horse course.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,790
And in the first lecture we're going to

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,460
start talking about basic equine
physiology or horse physiology.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,020
And we're going to use the horse, but
again, all this

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,240
will apply to the other subspecies,
donkeys, zebras, and what have you.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,634
So the basic anatomy of a horse is very
similar

8
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:26,075
to other livestock species but there are
some key differences.

9
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:31,569
And, it's really important to understand
at least their external physiology

10
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:35,882
and the terms associated with that because
a lot of the terms.

11
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:38,474
You know, not only are we going to be
referring to them, you know,

12
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:40,490
throughout this course which we've already
done

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,342
the previous week and, and going forward.

14
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,597
But, you know, any time you're involved in
the

15
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:47,127
horse industry or you own donkeys, you
know, you're

16
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:49,272
going to need to know these terms because
we, you

17
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:52,380
know, we call specific parts of their
bodies specific things.

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,620
So that's kind of why we, we felt that it
was important

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,680
to kind of you know, address this in just
one lecture.

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,300
But obviously, you know, you could take

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,010
an entire Coursera course talking about
just physiology.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,100
So, you know, we're going to go cover.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,440
What we can this week, you know, and then
going forward in the course.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,150
So, this is just the outlet, outlay,
outlaying

25
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,590
area of the horse and the external
anatomy.

26
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,200
And, and I know it kind of looks a lot at
first, but once you start calling

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,430
it and getting used to calling certain
terms,

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,130
you know, it, it, it becomes relatively
easy and.

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,950
You know, before we jump in kind of look
at specific areas of the

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,740
horse I, I did want to bring this up that,
70% of a horse's

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,180
weight is in its front end and, you know,
we're going to look at

32
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,990
skeletal anatomy briefly and you'll see,
you know, some of the, the reasons why.

33
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,690
But, you know, not only do you have the
large, you know,

34
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,980
chest, shoulders but the neck and the head
all forward of the horse.

35
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,440
So that's where a lot of weight is.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,300
In these animals.

37
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,280
Now, if we just focus in on, you know,

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,450
the front portion of the horse, you know,
you're

39
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,170
going to, starting with the bottom of the
chin, or

40
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,600
what we call the throat latch working it's
way over.

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,790
And I did kind of want to highlight the
crest here, and

42
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,070
that's just, is the area running, you
know, all along down the neck.

43
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,540
And sometimes you'll hear people say a
horse is cresty.

44
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,700
Now sometimes that means, you know,
they're arching their neck.

45
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,020
You know, we see this with stallions quite
a lot,

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,750
you know, when they're around mares and
kind of showing off.

47
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,450
But also horses that are overweight, you
know, we'll call them cresty in the neck.

48
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,460
And that's just because that's an area
where they deposit a lot of fat.

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,380
And starting in week four when we get into
nutrition.

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,770
We'll, we'll talk more about body
condition.

51
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,914
So, one area to, to kind of put away so

52
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:36,120
when we get to nutrition, you can kind of
remember that.

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,251
Now, working your way down the back of the
horse, you can see the shoulders and

54
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:43,990
then of course the withers, you know, we,
we talk about the withers quite a lot.

55
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,420
We've already talked about the withers,
you know, especially when

56
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,210
we talked about hands, you know, measuring
the height of

57
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,390
the horse from the withers to the ground
and then

58
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,350
working your way back, you know, the back
and the loin.

59
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,478
And then, you know, if you just imagine
this

60
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,718
is where a rider would almost sit, and
they're

61
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:03,700
kind of in between the back and the loin,
you know, and then going down to the tail.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,180
Now looking underneath the horse, you
know, what you

63
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,765
will find is if you look at the canon
area.

64
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:17,120
Down, on all four legs the, those
structures are all called the same, so,

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,010
you know, you have the cannon going down
to the fetlock, the pastern, and the hoof.

66
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,860
So that's similar between all four front
and back legs.

67
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,520
But when you start dividing front versus
back, you do start to see differences.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,070
So in the front you've got the knee, the
forearm, the elbow.

69
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,610
And then in the back, you've got the hock,

70
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,560
the gaskin, and then going up to the
stifle.

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,910
Okay, so there are differences.

72
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,190
So it's almost like our, our, our front
arms are in the front half of the horse.

73
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,380
And our legs are in the back half of the
horse.

74
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,630
And that will be important too when we
look at some of the skeletal anatomy.

75
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,310
You'll see some of the familiar terms.

76
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,750
So jumping into that I do want to

77
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,490
say, you know, don't worry about
memorizing certain bones.

78
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,790
It's not going to be on an exam or a quiz
but I do want to address it

79
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,440
just so you kind of see, you know, the
horse

80
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,390
and the skeletal structure and where,
where it is.

81
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,250
Again, 70% of the weight.

82
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,870
So it's not hard to see from this slide.

83
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,830
Looking at the large rib area, the neck,
the, the cranium.

84
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,110
You know, all that weight in the front
half of the horse, you know?

85
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,910
That's where you, you know?

86
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,120
It's easier to see that.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,480
Now, if we start at the top.

88
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,060
You know, just some basic terms of the
cranium and the teeth and, and the neck.

89
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,010
But what's interesting is the horse does
have this kind of S

90
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,120
orientation of the cervical vertebrae and
what's really supporting the neck not only

91
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,110
is the bone structure supporting the neck
but you do have a ligaments

92
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,410
or series of ligaments and then quite a
bit of muscling in there.

93
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,610
So that's really what's helping support
the, the head carriage of the horse.

94
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,970
So, so kind of every time, you know, you
see

95
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,920
a horse skeleton you see that it's kind of
surprising.

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,230
Now, if we just looked at the barrel of
the horse of

97
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,980
the, the main body of the horse I mean
obviously they, they

98
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,950
have a large shoulder, large scapula bone
and then you could see

99
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,460
the, the different vertebrae going from
the thoracic down to the tail.

100
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,940
Two areas I did want to highlight is again
similar to external anatomy.

101
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,660
That front portion is, is almost like our
arm.

102
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,000
So that's the humerus bone which is what
called here on,

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,180
on us and then they have the femur in the
back leg.

104
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,690
Which is similar to our large leg bone,
our femur.

105
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,660
Now looking at the lower anatomy, skeletal
anatomy again very similar like the

106
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,520
external anatomy from the cannon bone down
all four legs are the same.

107
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,640
So you're looking at, at similar
terminology with the

108
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,560
long pastern, the short pastern, and then
the coffin bone.

109
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,030
From that point upwards, there's
differences

110
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,230
between the front and hind legs.

111
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,590
So, in the front, again, you have the
knee, the carpus.

112
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,530
But, ag, you know, again, in reference to
arm, the

113
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,680
radius and ulna which is actually our
lower arm bones.

114
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,510
So, that's where that is in the horse.

115
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,370
And then in, in the hind end of the horse,
obviously you have the hocks.

116
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,750
But going up, you know, we have that
femur.

117
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:15,060
But then you have the tibia and fibia
which again, similar to, to our lower leg.

118
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,150
There's two bones there.

119
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,480
So, so some things just to, to kind of
remember with skeletal anatomy.

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,870
Now, muscle anatomy.

121
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,960
You're probably thanking me that we will
not go over this quite a bit.

122
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,240
It's pretty in depth, it actually gives
you a really great appreciation for, you

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,250
know, your veterinarians and other medical
folks

124
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,290
that need to know all of these muscles.

125
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,410
But again, I just put this slide up to
show you just

126
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,490
how muscular these horses are, how many
different muscles are working in

127
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,070
con, in conjunction with each other to
propel them, to allow them

128
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,150
to run, as fast as they do, and, and keep
them upright.

129
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,290
So, so pretty interesting to see all that.

130
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,810
Now, the digestive anatomy, we're going to
cover in greater depth during week four.

131
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,130
You know, what, what each organ does in
the digestive tract.

132
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,220
But again, just to kind of visualize, you
know, the, the viscera of the horse and

133
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,270
just how large these organs are if you've

134
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,360
ever seen them, you know, in a colic
surgery.

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,398
I've been fortunate enough to, to see a
couple of those,

136
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:17,510
and it's just amazing to see how large
these, these organs are.

137
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,290
And then going into week six, we'll, we'll
cover more into the reproductive anatomy.

138
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,320
Really focusing mainly a lot on the mare,

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,909
because that has a specific implications
for mare management.

140
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,694
Now, in our next lecture, we're going to
jump into hoof anatomy and so,

141
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:34,410
it's, it's just as important as some

142
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,780
of this external anatomy that we talked
about.

143
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,040
So, I look forward to seeing you then.
