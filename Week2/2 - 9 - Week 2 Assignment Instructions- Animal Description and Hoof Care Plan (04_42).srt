1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,080
All right.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,100
In this video, we are just going to do a,
a quick

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,650
tutorial on the weekly assignment and
kind of what the expectations are.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,790
I, I really felt like this would help you
kind of understand what's

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,135
expected, and the whole idea of this, you
know, weekly assignment that

6
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:21,330
we're doing in the horse course, is for
you to take the

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,400
information that we're, we're giving each
week, and apply it to an animal.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,890
You know, as an educator I always feel,
when, when students apply the information.

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,090
They tend to retain it more, you know, and
longer.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,760
So, for this assignment, in the beginning
we're asking you to choose an

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,560
animal, a, you know any type of equid that
you would like to own.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,890
Whether it's a horse, donkey, mule, or a
hy.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,120
Other type of hybrid, or a zebra, you
know,

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,000
use your imagination if you're choosing a
hypothetical animal.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,560
If you actually own horses, donkeys, mules
etc.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,770
You can actually choose one of them and

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,110
apply the assignments each week to that
animal.

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,582
Now, you know, for a quick brief
description, you know, in my example I

19
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:07,150
would say I, I'm choosing a horse i'm
going to choose an American quarter horse.

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,260
And it's going to be a gelding.

21
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,800
And then I'm actually going to use this
animal, to do western pleasure riding.

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,370
And that's all we would, we, you know, I'm
asking you to use in your description.

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,970
That way when each week, you know, and
that's going to affect the

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,930
type of assignments you know, or the type
of plans that you develop.

25
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,190
You know, for example, I'm, I'm doing
western pleasure riding.

26
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,160
That means I need to ride this animal
almost every day, you know,

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,644
through the, throughout the week, doing
training,

28
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:35,090
so that's going to affect its nutrition
status.

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,340
That's going to affect my health care
plan.

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,490
That has many implications, so.

31
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,990
So, you know, choose what you'd like and
just write a brief description on that.

32
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,920
And then the real focus of this week's
assignment is a hoof care plan.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,340
And, we've gone through all the, the
information, you know, from basic

34
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,320
hoof care going all the way to laminitis
and why it's so important.

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,460
So, so the first, you know, part of that
hoof care plan is.

36
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,840
You know, trimming feet.

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
And you have to ask yourself, you know,
how often am I going to do this?

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,030
So you go back in the notes and look at

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,160
frequency, look at the place where you
live in the world.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,882
You know, look at those different factors.

41
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,960
And kind of get an idea, well, for this
animal

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,810
I probably have to do it every six weeks.

43
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,660
Or, you know, for this animal, you know,

44
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,920
it's pretty dry, arid region, maybe every
eight weeks.

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,300
So, you know, decide on that.

46
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,450
And then ask yourself, am I going to do
this myself, or am

47
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,210
I going to have a farrier come in and do
it for me?

48
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,760
So, if you're doing it yourself, then I'm
going to ask

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,680
you to look up your supplies, a hoof pick
and all

50
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,900
the other stuff you may, you may need, and
just come

51
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,010
up with a brief list, not a very co,
comprehensive list.

52
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,980
But just a brief list of the tools you'll
need,

53
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,010
and, and, and price those out using your
local currency.

54
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,900
Where you are in the world.

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,480
Now if you are using a farrier.

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,530
Then, then find out how much it would cost
for

57
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,650
a farrier to come in and trim all four
feet.

58
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,120
So you could make a quick phone call.

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,190
You can look on the internet.

60
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,950
Use any resource you want.

61
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,100
You know, even in the local paper.

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,780
And get an idea of how much a hoof trim
would cost you.

63
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,930
All right, and then this is the second
question on

64
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,420
this assignment is, are you going to put
shoes on your animal?

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,000
So, you know if, if, if you're not
going to shoe your

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,560
animal, then just briefly in, in a couple
of sentences state why.

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,030
You know, I want to keep my animal
barefoot because, or I really, you

68
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,550
know, I'm going to keep them on pasture
and not ride them very much, etc.

69
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,950
So, so that's how you would, you would
reason that.

70
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,455
If you do plan on shoeing your animal,
then just find out from your

71
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:36,876
farrier how much it's going to cost to put
four shoes on all four hooves,

72
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:40,298
so a one time deal, you know, how much it
would cost you in

73
00:03:40,298 --> 00:03:44,899
your local currency, and then that's it,
so that's it for this week's assignment.

74
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,450
Now, for evaluation, you're actually
going to evaluate your peers.

75
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,120
So we're going to ask you to go in each

76
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,790
week, and evaluate at least three of your
peers.

77
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:01,490
You're just checking for completeness, and
that it's pretty accurate.

78
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,390
Now, remember, a lot of folks in this
class, enrolled in this class.

79
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,190
English may not be their primary language.

80
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,500
So we're not grading on grammar and
spelling.

81
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,400
But we're really looking at content.

82
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,420
So, you know, are they going to trim their
feet often enough?

83
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,150
Do the prices look reasonable?

84
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,250
And, and again, if it's in local

85
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,080
currency, that's going to be hard to
kind of evaluate.

86
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,660
and, so you're going to complete this
assignment by

87
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,470
the end of this week, of week two.

88
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,010
And, then you're peer evals will be due by
the end of week three.

89
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,660
So they're a week behind.

90
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,090
We'll release those at the beginning of
week three, and then

91
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,270
you finish 'em and finish 'em by the end
of week three.

92
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,564
And then we'll move on to the next
assignment.

93
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:36,804
