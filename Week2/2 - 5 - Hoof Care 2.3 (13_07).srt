1
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:04,540
Alright, welcome back.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,760
And in this lecture,
we're going to talk about hoof care.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,620
And again, this is one that, that I
decided to re-record from the first run.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,495
Really, when I initially did this, I,I,

5
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:16,770
I didn't intend to teach people
how to trim a, a horses foot.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,880
I, I just wanted to review it because
it's such a critical part of their,

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,530
their health.

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,730
So, I'm just going to put
this disclaimer upfront that,

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,470
that's not the intention of this lecture.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,430
It's not to teach you how to
properly trim a horses foot because

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,000
really that should be done by
a trained professional or you,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
yourself can go out and get trained
on how to do this with your animal.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,530
But if you do this improperly, you can
injure them, so we, we don't want that,

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,990
that's not the intention of this.

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,460
It's just to give you the information
on maybe what a farrier or

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,320
a trained professional is looking at,
when they're trimming their feet.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,010
So, just keep that in mind as
we go through this lecture.

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,240
Now, it's always good to review
the anatomy because, you know,

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,020
in the previous lectures, we were
talking about the importance of that.

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,990
So here, you can see the,
the anatomy of the bottom of the hoof,

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,120
and we're going to kind of
talk about some of this.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,216
Now, why do we need to trim a,
a horses hoof?

23
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,546
What, you know, what's going on?

24
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:15,410
And really, you know,
we took these animals from the wild

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,080
where they would be out, you know
naturally wearing down their hooves.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,640
Their hooves would be adjusting to
the environment that they're in and

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,520
they would get natural wear and tear.

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,850
But as soon as we put them in pastures,
or stalls or paddocks.

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,580
We've taken away that opportunity for
them to, to wear down their hooves.

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,670
So, you know, we, that's why we
have to take care of their feet.

31
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,800
Now this image on the right.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,810
You can see, that, that is a,
a severely neglected, neglected animal.

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,650
I, I only put this in here to show you,
you know, how the hoof grows.

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,030
And what happens if we
don't take care of them.

35
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,060
So a little shock value.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,770
I apologize.

37
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,800
But, again, that's why it's so important.

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,820
And we really,
really need to take care of these animals.

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,170
Now, in nature, if, you know,
let's say zebra, you know, being chased

40
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,690
here by a lion, has hoof problems well,
they're going to get picked off.

41
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,880
And, you know, if, if, if you look at, you
know, how nature works, if an animal has

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,570
an injury or an illness, you know, they're
going to get picked off by a predator.

43
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,240
Those genetics generally won't be passed
on, you know to the, to the future,

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,170
so horses that are in the wild or
are wild equids tend to have strong feet.

45
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,910
You know, they, they've kind of
evolved that way, whereas you know,

46
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,720
in domestication we really haven't
selected these animals too much,

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,170
especially in, you know,
recent years to have strong feet.

48
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,890
That we really have selected them for
performance or

49
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,900
how they look, stuff like that.

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,180
Now, you know, again, it's a,

51
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,070
you know, just to reiterate why we
need to take care of those feet.

52
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,450
If not, it, it can develop, you know, foot
diseases, things that we call, you know,

53
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,580
lameness or laminitis, which you're
going to get in the next lecture.

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,440
So again,
that's why we want to take care of them.

55
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,510
Now this is something everybody should do,
you know, whether you, you,

56
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,270
know how to trim a hoof or
not, or you're a farrier or

57
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,570
not, everybody should inspect
their animals' feet daily.

58
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,080
You know, especially when we get to
the health lectures we'll talk about,

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,480
you know, inspecting your animal daily to
make sure they're, they're healthy and

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,600
everything's okay and
they don't have any, you know, wounds.

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,320
This is something you want to do,
you want to pick up their feet daily and

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,990
clean their feet daily, which in the next
slide we talk about, with a hoof pick.

63
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,710
So most you know anybody and
if you need you know,

64
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,850
someone to show you how to do this,
it's relatively simple.

65
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,130
To get a hoof pick, you know,

66
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,810
you, you probably to do need to know how
to you know, properly restrain a horse.

67
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,470
And then also how to pick
their feet up safely.

68
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,040
So you, you definitely want somebody to,
to show you how to do that.

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,310
But once you do and you know how to hold
their feet, you know, when you're picking

70
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,742
their feet, you always want to start
at the heel and work towards the toe.

71
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:51,710
And the reason we do
that is you don't want

72
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,510
this hoof pick driving into
the soft tissue of the frog.

73
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,520
Which you've gotten in
the previous lectures.

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,980
You know,
the frog has high moisture content,

75
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,640
so you actually can injure them or
injure the frog.

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,499
So you always want to start at the heel,
and work towards the toe, and

77
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:12,806
you just want to clean that debris out,
to, to keep the hoof healthy.

78
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:15,590
Now, getting into, to hoof trimming,
again, that disclaimer that you

79
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,840
really only want to do this if
you're a trained professional.

80
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,850
But you want your horse to get their feet
trimmed about every six to eight weeks.

81
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,510
If you, if you remember the,
the previous lecture, you know the,

82
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,240
the hoofs grow at about
half an inch a month.

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
So it grows relatively quickly.

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,770
Kind of like our fingernails or toenails.

85
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,090
So you want someone to come out and
take care of their feet.

86
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,000
Now, that's going to vary, obviously,
on all those things we talked about,

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,790
environment, and
how they're being used but, you know,

88
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,010
you definitely want them to,
to come out and look.

89
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,140
Now, I put this image in here.

90
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,290
This is, again, a neglected animal but

91
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,550
just to show you that the toe
does grow faster than the heal.

92
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,480
I mean, that's a really,
really overgrown toe.

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,520
On that poor animal.

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,720
But just to get that kind of image
burned in your mind that the toe does

95
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,180
grow faster with that.

96
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,740
And then also another note
again with that frog,

97
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,070
we want to be really careful around the
frog because it's that softer tissue, so.

98
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,920
If you cut too much of the frog, or
you know, trim too much of the frog,

99
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,800
it can injure them and
lead to further problems.

100
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,980
So anytime you're working with the frog,
you just want to,

101
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,127
you just want to be careful.

102
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:25,520
[COUGH] Now, when a professional
is looking at your, your animal,

103
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,039
what they're going to be looking at is,
is hoof balance.

104
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,480
Okay.
And we're going to show you

105
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,560
different angles of this and, and how they
may be looking at that animal's hoof.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,090
So, you know, they want to make sure that
hoof is, is carrying that animal and

107
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,430
is distributing the weight evenly, okay?

108
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,800
If not, then that can actually lead to,
to, not only, you know, foot lameness, but

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,010
other issues, too, with muscles and,
and joints and stuff like that.

110
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,796
So, you want to make sure,
you know, their health really,

111
00:05:55,796 --> 00:06:00,210
kind of starts, begin, begins at the feet.

112
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,690
And we want to make sure that,
it's properly balanced.

113
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,450
Okay, and so
to continue this hoof balance, you know,

114
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,810
I found this from this wonderful website,
talking about, you know, heel toe issues.

115
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,910
You know, with confirmation.

116
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,630
So just to show you, you know, this image
on the left says it has a heel issue.

117
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,960
So what that means is, we've really
gotta kind of trim some of the heel,

118
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,950
that would carry this foot
a little bit forward.

119
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,990
Now this second image, right here.

120
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,590
Has a toe issue.

121
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,370
So you, to bring that back in line you'd
want to probably trim some of the toe and

122
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,270
that would bring it back there.

123
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,150
Because really what we want is them
standing square on top of that hoof.

124
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,890
So again, it would take a,

125
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,927
a trained professional looking
at your animal to see that.

126
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:42,310
Now.

127
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,320
Also when they're trimming their feet
they want to look at it from the side.

128
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,270
So you can see here, you know,
with these three images.

129
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,310
You know the, the first one on
the left is called Broken-Back so

130
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,600
we always look,
like to look at the pastern.

131
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,830
The angle of the pastern in the hoof.

132
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,780
So here's Ideal,
it's almost a straight line.

133
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,780
And then here you can see
the angle of the pastern.

134
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,294
That's called Broken-Forward.

135
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,420
So what we need to do is trim
either some of the toe or

136
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,360
the heel to bring that back in line.

137
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,480
Now, starting with the front one we would
want to trim off some of that toe and

138
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,690
that would actually rotate
this back a little bit.

139
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,390
To bring it into the ideal position.

140
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,170
In the broken forward we would trim
off a little bit of the heal and

141
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,392
that would drop the foot to bring
it in line with the paster angle.

142
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:36,870
But again, a trained professional,
that's what they're looking for and

143
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,310
that's probably what
they're doing with it.

144
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,200
Now in this image you can see,
you know, a hoof that is improper.

145
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,160
Or this is a neglected animal.

146
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,060
And then this is the proper, you know,
shape of the hoof that we're looking for.

147
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,810
So I think this image kind of shows you,
you know, what we're trying to get.

148
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,760
Now if you came across an animal that was
this overgrown you would not want to trim

149
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,830
it to this, again you want a farrier
professional to do this because you know,

150
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,370
especially, an animal that
has an overgrown hoof,

151
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,490
if you just all the sudden get it
back into what it should look like,

152
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,420
perfect, you know, it could cause issues
and some soreness and stuff like that.

153
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,220
So again, a trained professional
is somebody that can do that.

154
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,140
Now, just to give you a couple examples,
again I wanted to show you this one.

155
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,630
So if you look at the pastern angle.

156
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,680
And then the hoof angle.

157
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,980
So if you ask yourself would I need to,
to remove some of the toe or

158
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,970
would I need to remove some of
the heel to bring that back in line.

159
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,060
So let's say we remove some of the heel,
what would that do?

160
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,680
Okay so if we,

161
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,090
if we, if we you know trimmed it down
here what that would do is drop the hoof.

162
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,680
And would bring this angle up.

163
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,100
So that's not what we want to do.

164
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,510
What we'd actually want to do with
this one is trim some of the toe.

165
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,170
Okay, and
that will drop the hoof a little bit.

166
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,900
And that will get it more in length,

167
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,480
in angle with the pastern, okay?

168
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,210
Now with this one,
I also included a couple images.

169
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,980
So here's your file.

170
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,170
Which generally is like a nail-file.

171
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,390
So, it's, it's generally safer to use,

172
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,420
especially if you're learning
how to do this in the beginning.

173
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,030
You do have to be careful first,
it will cut you.

174
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,190
They, they are sharp.

175
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,650
I've, I've cut my hands on them
by grabbing them wrong before.

176
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,015
And also, you can take a lot
of hoof off rather quickly.

177
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:28,050
So, you know,
you want to use the finer side and

178
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,610
work slowly especially when you're if,
if you're a novice and

179
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,490
you're trying to learn how to do this,
you know, under trained, eyes.

180
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,690
The next is the nippers which again you
have to be extremely cautious using.

181
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,820
This can take off a lot of hoof fast.

182
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,000
So again, you don't want to use this,
unless you're really tra, trained.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,370
And then this hoof knife.

184
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,360
And actually have for, for righties and
lefties they, they make different hoof

185
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,820
knives and that's actually to help with
the sole and, and some other things.

186
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,380
So if you look at this,
this image of this hoof here, obviously,

187
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,400
we've got some overgrown parts.

188
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,250
The frogs pretty overgrown
a little bit here.

189
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:11,120
And you can see the, the, just the overall
shape of, of the hoof isn't too bad.

190
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,130
But that hoof definitely has some
areas where it needs to be trimmed.

191
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,550
And this is probably something, you know,

192
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,320
if you waited eight weeks you would see
and say okay I need to look at that.

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,590
Here's some areas that are sticking out,
I need to trim here and there.

194
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,860
But again, it, it, it could be a whole
Coursera course on hoof trimming

195
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,220
just to get you almost ready to be able
to pick up a hoof and, and start to,

196
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,690
to trim it properly.

197
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,460
So there's that.

198
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,560
Now the last part of this is shoeing.

199
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,270
And, you know,
we had some interesting discussions when,

200
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,080
when I've talked about this in,
in the previous version of Coursera.

201
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,330
And different attitudes.

202
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,120
And, and I've looked at some research.

203
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,590
And some, there's some
interesting research coming out,

204
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,680
I think it was out of Michigan State,
talking about how hooves,

205
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,860
you know, are stronger if, if they're
barefoot and left alone over time.

206
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,020
So there is some research starting to
emerge that leaving horses barefoot can,

207
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,238
can actually be better for them.

208
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:07,080
But again, since we use these animals in,
in all different types of situations.

209
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,060
That doesn't necessarily mean we,
we would never want to shoe them.

210
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,870
And shoeing is, is, is really often
necessary to protect the animal.

211
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,000
So, you know,
what are some of the things that,

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,020
that shoeing does is it helps reduces
wear on the, on the, on the feet.

213
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,530
And, you know, from my own
experience on a research project,

214
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,830
I had some mares exercising.

215
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,910
In kind of a, sandy, you know,
free, free flow exerciser, and

216
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,610
their hooves were really
getting worn down.

217
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,230
And we had to put shoes on them,
to protect their feet.

218
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,050
Because I,
I didn't want to harm them obviously.

219
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,320
So, you know,
that was one area where, you know,

220
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,280
if you noticed the use of the animal, and
they're really starting to get, you know.

221
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,237
Thin hooves and, and low,
you definitely want to put shoes on them.

222
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:53,830
Now, for some of these animals that
are actually ridden on asphalt or

223
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,640
concrete you know for
their work you know like police

224
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,360
horses often times they're going to need
shoes which is going to help traction,

225
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,460
there's also rubber shoes that help
cushion these animals a little bit.

226
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,480
And then obviously any time a, a trained
professional or a farrier says hey,

227
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,670
we need some corrective shoeing to,
to help your animal or

228
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,660
a veterinarian recommends that, obviously
you're going to need to put shoes on them.

229
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,720
So, so sometimes we,
we do need it, need it.

230
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,420
And, it's really just up to
your individual situation.

231
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,430
So, you know, again,
based on your chosen activity.

232
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,190
And, and I would say if your animal's kept
in pasture and that's, that's their life,

233
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,830
they're not being ridden
really all that much, or

234
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,410
they're not out on hard surfaces,
stuff like that, will you need shoes?

235
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,380
Probably not.
I mean,

236
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,570
you're not going to need them out there.

237
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,700
But you still need to
check your animal's feet.

238
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,600
They still need to be cleaned daily.

239
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
And they still need their hooves trimmed,
so don't forget that.

240
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,330
Just because they're not on pasture,
doesn't mean you forget about them,

241
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,890
you, you have to really take care of them.

242
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,840
Now if you're out competing, out riding a
lot, yeah, most likely yes, because again

243
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,900
like I said in my own personal experience,
you know these animals, constant wear on

244
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,400
their feet, going over hard surfaces,
they're getting that wear and tear.

245
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,920
So shoes will help protect them.

246
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,180
But, best advice like always is talk to
a professional, talk to your farrier.

247
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,420
Have them look at your animal.

248
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,270
Talk to him about what you're doing.

249
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,590
And they'll give you the best advice then.

250
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,560
Alright, so that's it.

251
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,610
So what's next?

252
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,211
Next is, you know, obviously not a very
fun topic but very, very important.

253
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:26,581
And that's laminitis.

254
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:27,649
So I'll see you then.

255
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,701
[MUSIC]

256
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:38,461
Oops.
