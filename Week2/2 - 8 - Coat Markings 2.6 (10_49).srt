00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,329
All right.

3
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:09,873
Welcome back, and in this next lecture,
we're going to talk about coat markings.

4
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:13,377
So you know really again, the two areas
that we're going to

5
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:16,320
look at is, is the face, and then also the
leg.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,970
So we're going to kind of walk through
this, and, and give

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,560
you the verbiage on what we call different
markings on the face.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,420
So, you know, looking at this image, at
the end of this lecture,

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,160
you should easily be able to identify all
of these markings on these horses.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,650
So, the first marking is what we call a
star.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,700
And, these can be really subtle, really
light, I

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,490
mean, sometimes you just see some white
hair in there.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,920
Or, they can be what I call bold,

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,630
they're really bright, you know, really,
really there.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,140
So, you know, in this image, this would be
a faint

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,540
one and then this one would be like a
really bold star.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,550
And if you wanted to see what this looked
like on, you know, actual horses.

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,040
So, here's one where it's just a very
faint star, this one's kind of middle

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,650
of the road, and not all the time,

20
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,420
you know, they're, they're going to be
different patterns.

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,790
They're, they're always not circular.

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,310
And then here's one with a pretty bold
star right there.

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,450
That, that's pretty out there, I mean,
you, you

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,330
can see that and you're like, Oh, that's a
star.

25
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,370
So, that's what we call, you know, any

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,790
marking, you know, between the eyes and
the forehead.

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,710
And then we'll go, we'll jump down to the,
to the

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,560
lips of the horse and then we call this a
snip.

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,060
So you can see here between the nasal
bones or

30
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,040
the upper lip of the horse, we call these
snips.

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,930
And again, they can be either really,
really

32
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,250
bold or they can be really, really subtle.

33
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,070
Again with these two, you know, obviously
here too.

34
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,740
You can see, really there's no more white

35
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,969
markings on that, that's just snips on the
horse.

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,130
And that's what we call that.

37
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,260
And then the middle one, is a strip, or
sometimes some people call a it stripe.

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,930
Which, either or is okay.

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,180
And the white is between the nasal bone.

40
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,340
So if you look at the nasal bone of the
horse

41
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,540
here and here, you can see the white in
between that.

42
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,130
So when, when we do see that then it's a
strip or a stripe.

43
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,430
Okay.

44
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,130
And again here, this horse is pretty bold,
but again, still

45
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,460
between the nasal bones we would still
call that a strip.

46
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,850
Now with most horses it's, you know,
they're going to

47
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,200
have a, a combination of these on the
face.

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,640
They're, they're either going to have one
or two or all three.

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
And we also call these, you know,

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,830
we either say they're continuous or
non-continuous.

51
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,810
So continuous is, you know, the best
example All three, or all four of these,

52
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,960
here, are continuous where, you know, you
have the star, the strip, and the snip.

53
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,930
So in all three of them, it's, they're all
running together.

54
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,190
Noncontinuous is, is the example right
here, where you do have

55
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,750
a star, you do have a strip, and you do
have a snip, but it's, it's broken.

56
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,690
So if you wanted to see this again on, on

57
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,450
real horses, here's one with a continuous
star strip snip.

58
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,310
Okay, and then on this foal you have a
star and a

59
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,310
strip, and then on this horse you have a
star and a snip.

60
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,600
Okay.

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,860
So, pretty easy with the facial markings.

62
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,510
Now, the one where people sometimes get
confused

63
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,090
and that's between a strip and a blaze.

64
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,440
Okay.

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,970
A blaze, we consider it a blaze anytime
that white

66
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,370
starts to either meet or exceed outside
those nasal bones.

67
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,739
So this picture is a pretty clear
definition of what we would call blaze.

68
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,670
Now again, seeing this on, on live horses,
this one here you

69
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,040
can definitely see that it's got the
flaxen mane, mane and tail.

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,730
You can see it's outside the nasal bones,
it's

71
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,030
clearly a blaze, and that's we call a
blaze.

72
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,840
Now this, it gets a little tricky, you
know,

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,880
once you get these horses that again are
in between.

74
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,520
Maybe somebody would say star, strip,
snip.

75
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,088
Okay.

76
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,327
I mean you can get away with that.

77
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:54,063
But again, you know, this you would

78
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:56,359
probably clearly define as a blaze because
it's

79
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,220
meet in the nasal bones or exceeding a
little bit of the nasal bones there.

80
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,030
So that's what a blaze would look like.

81
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,650
Now there's, there's some really cool
white

82
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,050
markings too that, that have some special
nomenclature.

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,540
And the first is a bald face so you can
see this full.

84
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,140
Where the white blaze extends past the
eyes, so you know, all of

85
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,990
the white is in the face, and we call that
a bald face.

86
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,910
And then the next one is really neat too,
and that's called an apron.

87
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,660
And this is where you get, you know, it,
it, again, it's called

88
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,620
an apron because it looks like somebody
put an apron over their face.

89
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,980
Where you get the white running up

90
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,770
almost underneath the throat latch with
this horse.

91
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,310
So that's what we call an apron.

92
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,500
And then one of my favorites.

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,850
I, I think this one's always great too, is
called the medicine hat.

94
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,690
And you can see it's just the dark areas

95
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,860
around the, the top of the head and the
ears.

96
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,360
So there, and if they have that, we call
that a medicine hat.

97
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,310
So I think it's, I think it's really cool,
I think it's really cool marking.

98
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,680
So the, that's kind of the, you know, sums
up most

99
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,450
of the facial markings that, that are most
common amongst horses.

100
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,010
The next is the leg markings, and we're
going to work our way up.

101
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,990
So we'll start at the hoof and work our
way up the leg And the first

102
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,390
one is when you just have some white just
along the hoof, or just above the hoof.

103
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,030
So we either call them a white heel

104
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,490
or, or you'll sometimes hear the term
ermine marks.

105
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,180
And in this next image, in these next two
images you can clearly see

106
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,320
where the white is along the heel here, so
that's pretty clearly a white heel.

107
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,640
And then, here you can see there's some
white here, white here.

108
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,930
And it's kind of non continuous.

109
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,220
Kindof spotty around there.

110
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,810
And those we would probably call ermine
marks.

111
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,010
So when there's just a little bit of white
above the hoof.

112
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,520
Now, if it is continuous runs all along
the hoof,

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,450
of the bottom of the hoof, around that
coronary band.

114
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,980
Remember, this is where that anatomy kind
of helps to, to remember

115
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,290
because a lot of these markings on the leg
refer to the anatomy.

116
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,630
And when there's just some white, just
above that, but really

117
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,450
not too far up the pasture, we would call
that a coronet.

118
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,690
Now, the next one is when you do have
white running up the

119
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,910
coronet, but does...or excuse me, from the
coronet up the pastern, but stops

120
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,330
at the fetlock here, so you can see it
runs all the way

121
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,198
up the pastern but stops at the fetlock,
and we'll call that a pastern.

122
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:24,498
Now this one you can see it's half way up

123
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:28,840
the pastern and some of the white runs up
here.

124
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
So you kind of see that so I'll make a
little boot.

125
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,320
So there you go.

126
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,800
So you can see where some of that white
runs up.

127
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,400
Some people may say that's a partial
pastern because it almost

128
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,010
looks like a cornet, but you have some
white running up it.

129
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,650
They would call that a partial pastern.

130
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,750
So, again looking on a live animal, or
what would be in a live animal,

131
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,290
rather than in a picture, there you can
see what is clearly marked a pastern.

132
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,600
Now, when it does go above the fetlock,
that's when we would call it a fetlock,

133
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,480
or sometimes you have that white running
up

134
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,910
partially, some people may call that a
partial fetlock.

135
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,890
So, here.

136
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,360
You can see here where it's about the
fetlock joint.

137
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,760
So here's the fetlock joint here, and it's
above it.

138
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,710
Almost a sock, which is our next one, but
not quite.

139
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,380
So we would probably call that a fetlock.

140
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,180
Now a sock, what we call a sock is
generally when

141
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,630
the white runs up about half-way up the
canon bone, okay.

142
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,210
But does not go up above the knee on the
front legs, or the hawk on the hind leg.

143
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,340
So this is the hock on the hind legs.

144
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,100
So the white is almost halfway up, but
doesn't

145
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,290
exceed there, so that's what we would call
a sock.

146
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,210
So again looking at these horses, you can
see the cannon

147
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:50,230
bone halfway, halfway, that's a sock,
halfway, halfway, those are socks.

148
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,089
Now again, if it ran up here, you can see
here again drawn that.

149
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,760
Weird looking boot there.

150
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,220
You can see where you know that would be
still a sock

151
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,760
so not quite the next one which is called
a, a stocking.

152
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,080
So a stocking is when it actually reaches
the hock or the knees or goes above it.

153
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,690
So here's what we call a stocking And then
here on,

154
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,450
on the left is clear two stockings on the
hind legs.

155
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,750
So that's what we would call a stocking.

156
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,950
Now this next one, we do have a stocking
here, okay.

157
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,360
So here's the knees, okay so that white is
meeting

158
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,860
the knees, but this one doesn't extend
past the knees.

159
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,640
Now there's a little bit of white here,
but not

160
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,590
quite, so this one we would probably still
call a sock.

161
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,010
And then, this one we would call a
stocking, okay?

162
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,810
Now the final thing we'll talk about with
identification is these

163
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,260
weird things called chestnuts, or some
people call them night eyes.

164
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,725
And again, this is what's so cool about
horses or equids you know,

165
00:08:56,725 --> 00:09:00,960
donkeys have these to, is they, they think
this is a remnant from evolution.

166
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,530
Where, you know, if we remember, we went

167
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,770
from four, to three, to a single toed
animal.

168
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,940
And those, those toes migrated up the leg.

169
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,080
Well, they believe these, these chestnuts,
it's kind of just a, a remnant of that.

170
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,370
That that's still kind of around.

171
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,950
And what, what a lot of people believe,
too, is that these

172
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,740
really unique, each one's unique to

173
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,690
a horse where they're almost like
fingerprints.

174
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,790
Now, they do grow a little bit, so they
do, they,

175
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,490
they can scuff off kind of the dead skin
on there.

176
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,420
But some breed registries actually do
require photographs.

177
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,800
And like the jockey club in certain
circumstances will

178
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,430
actually require photography, you know
somebody have to go

179
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,020
in there and take a photograph of those
night

180
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,570
eyes as a, a unique mark to that animal.

181
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,380
So just be aware, you've always wondered
what

182
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,280
those weird things were, that's what they
are.

183
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,480
So that concludes the end of week two and
you know again this week we talked a

184
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,370
lot about hoof anatomy, you know
laminitis, hoof care

185
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,370
and then jumped into coat markings and
coat colors.

186
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,250
So just remind to take, take quiz two.

187
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,440
The quiz questions come directly from the
lectures and the slides so they

188
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,130
should be very, very straightforward if

189
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,760
you've been paying attention and taking
notes.

190
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,230
And also complete assignment one, so
that's going to be

191
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,230
due before week three which shouldn't take
you a whole heck

192
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,540
of a lot of time and you, I made a video

193
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,850
to clearly explain what the expectations
should be for that assignment.

194
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,185
And then you're going to be asked to do a
peer evaluation.

195
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:31,180
Of three, of at least three, of your peers
that

196
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,200
you can go in there and look at their
assignments.

197
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,572
Give them feedback, give them a score,

198
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:43,944
and that's going to be due by the end of
week

199
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:48,913
three, the beginning of week four.
