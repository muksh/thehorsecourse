1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,170
All right, welcome back and in this
lecture

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,070
we are going to start talking about coat
colors.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,810
Now, you know, first talking abut horse
identification and why it's important.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,950
You know, first, we need to be

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,470
able to distinguish between, you know,
different animals.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,590
So we use, you know, different markings to
do that.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,230
And it's also important for coat color and
markings,

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,400
you know, anything you do with the breed
registry.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,690
So this is actually a registry application
for the Australian Quarter horse industry.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,570
So hello to our friends down under.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,450
And you also, if, if you're dealing with

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,650
a veterinarians, your medical records, or
anything like that.

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,210
So the most simple way that we, we do this
is through coat color and coat markings.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,440
So that's really the purpose of the next
two lectures.

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,260
But before we jump into that, there are
some other aspects or other ways

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,020
that we do identify horses, and, and one
way we do that is branding.

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,100
Now, hot branding like you imagine with,
with cows, you

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,190
know, with the burning brand and, and, and
burning on there.

19
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,220
You routinely don't see with horses.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,820
You may see it occasionally, but it's
pretty rare.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,900
Really what's more common is what's called
freeze branding.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,780
That's where you take the brand and dip it

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,180
in liquid nitrogen and then hold it on the
horse.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,710
And what that does is it destroys the
pigment cells in the

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,740
skin, and then when the hair grows back,
it grows back white.

26
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,470
So that is what you are actually seeing is
a freeze brand.

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,420
So, that's, that's really, really common
in the horse

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,159
industry, at least here in the United
States it is.

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,260
Now, one technology that we're seeing more
and more of throughout the world

30
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,850
and here in the United States is
microchips, and here in the United

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,740
States, again, it's, it's a big industry
in our pet industry with our

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,640
cats and our dogs, and we do see it in the
horse industry.

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,340
And what this is a microchip that's about
the size

34
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,960
of a grain of rice that's put in the neck,

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,755
and then a handheld reader you, you run it
over

36
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:03,100
the neck, and it pops up a unique
identification number.

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,080
So we're starting to see that a lot more.

38
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,750
And then one that's, that's still around

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,580
that you still see, particularly with race
horses,

40
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,200
is a lip tattoo, where you actually have

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,050
an individual number that's assigned to
that horse.

42
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,930
So if you ever have an ex-race horse or
you do own a

43
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,890
race horse, you'll notice that they, they
will have a lip tattoo routinely.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,740
Now, that jumps into, really the two basic
ways of identifying horses and the first

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,600
is, in this lecture is coat colors, and

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,120
we're going to divide these really into
three categories.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,700
So, with colors with black points, you can
see

48
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,590
this picture, this is actually of a bay
horse

49
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,250
and when we talk about black points, we're
talking

50
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,830
about the mane, the tail, and then the
legs.

51
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,796
So you can see in this horse, those are
all black points.

52
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:51,220
Now, colors with non-black points, if you
look at the

53
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,700
same areas, and this is of a chestnut or
what we

54
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,030
call chestnut, you can see the mane, the
tail and

55
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,228
the legs are generally the similar color
of the horse itself.

56
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:05,720
So that's non-black points.

57
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,430
And then the third category is we're going
to

58
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,890
talk about white colors or white coat
color patterns.

59
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,830
So this horse, a grey horse, you see even
if

60
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,270
it has black points or non-black points,
it doesn't matter.

61
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,050
It's a white coat color pattern.

62
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,950
Now, the first color with black points
obviously is a black horse,

63
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,770
so there are black horses that have
completely, their entire coat is black.

64
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,390
So there's not brown or reddish hair, as
you can see in that picture.

65
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,590
Now, they may have white markings, so if
they do

66
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,560
have white markings, they can still be a
black horse.

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,790
And in the next lecture, we'll talk about
markings,

68
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,920
but those are generally around the legs
and the face.

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,790
So they can have white there, but

70
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,020
generally, their, their coat is entirely
black.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,500
Now, you may get a horse that looks kind

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,170
of black, but they actually have some
light areas.

73
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,190
So this is the black brown or what we call
as mealy.

74
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,430
And so what you're looking at here is you
can see in

75
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,710
this horse here around the flanks, the
muzzle, and around the tail,

76
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,540
you can see those lightened areas, so we
call that, that mealy,

77
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,430
and so this horse wouldn't be black; it
would actually be considered brown.

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,010
Now, there's different intensities of
brown, so it goes

79
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,900
anywhere from dark brown, seal brown to
light brown.

80
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,570
Now, here in this lecture I'll, I'll, I'll
kind of [LAUGH].

81
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,530
This is with, with, with all my students
this is what I run into.

82
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,400
Colors are not, you know, especially coat
colors, it, it's not a hard, fast rule.

83
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,640
There is some bleed over.

84
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,080
So, some people may say, well, that horse,

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,710
here let's just us this horse as an
example.

86
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,260
Well, I would call that dark brown.

87
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
And you're like, no, no, no, that's seal
brown.

88
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,310
Well, you know what?

89
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,510
We both could be right.

90
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,300
To me, that's a dark brown horse; to you,
it's a seal brown horse.

91
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,500
So you know, generally both of us could,
could be correct and really where we

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,170
start to see some of the overlap
especially when you go from brown to bay.

93
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,940
So a lot of times people that aren't
familiar

94
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,890
with coat colors, or it's kind of one
that's in between.

95
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,750
It could be brown.

96
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,020
It could be bay.

97
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,820
You know, you would, you would consider it
either or, and you both would be correct.

98
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,910
And, especially when we look at the
different intensities of bay.

99
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,380
You know, these dark or mahogany bays on a
day,

100
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,850
one day I may say, oh, it's a bay horse.

101
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,520
The next day I may say, oh, it's a brown
horse.

102
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,540
You know, you're both kind of correct, but
as you,

103
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,920
you see it starts to get lighter here and
here.

104
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,360
You know, the more proper term is that's a
bay horse.

105
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:43,200
Now, those were dis, you know, distinct
horse colors with black points.

106
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,400
Now, I'm going to cover one that can be
either or.

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,490
It can either have black points or
non-black points, and that's a dun.

108
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,840
So the duns are the, are, are the only
coat color that,

109
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,430
you know, we'll reference in this lecture,
or, or in this course.

110
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,870
That is a coat color with black or
non-black points.

111
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,700
Now, your typical duns, you know, or, or
what some people think typically

112
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,140
are duns are, are with the black points,
and they have that yellow-tan coat.

113
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,750
And then, you can see this dorsal stripe
down the back on this foal right here.

114
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,880
So, we call that the dorsal stripe.

115
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,530
And then also you get these, what we call

116
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,650
primitive markings or almost zebra
striping around the legs.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,620
So, those are what we call Duns.

118
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,520
Now, a buckskin looks like a dun, it just
doesn't have those markings.

119
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,190
It doesn't have the dorsal stripe or the
primitive markings on the legs.

120
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,340
So if it doesn't have that, but the
yellow-tan

121
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,940
coat and black points, we would call that
a buckskin.

122
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,430
Now, the duns with non-black points.

123
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,610
So, here you can see on this horse, this
is a dun, but you can look,

124
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,330
look at her, and you can see that she
doesn't have any of the black points.

125
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,500
You know, she has a yellow or almost
reddish coat color.

126
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,260
You know, we call those the red duns.

127
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,290
Their dorsal strip is either red or

128
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,320
a little bit lighter and those primitive
markings.

129
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,010
So, this horse does have the primitive

130
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,476
marking here and does have the dorsal
stripe.

131
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:09,320
So, these non-black point duns, you'll
hear them called claybanks;

132
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,839
you'll hear them called apricot duns,
strawberry duns, or red duns.

133
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,880
Now, to jump into the ones that are
definitely colors with non-black

134
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,320
points, the, the most common is the
chestnut as we highlighted earlier.

135
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,820
And you can see the, the coat color is
either red or brownish-red and

136
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,983
then also the, the tail and mane, you
know, usually dark red or brownish-red.

137
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,530
Now, if it is kind of a blonde mane and
tail, so

138
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,430
you can see here the blonde mane and tail
on this horse.

139
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,630
Okay.

140
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,460
We call that flaxen.

141
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,830
So then we would say, it's a chestnut with
a flaxen

142
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,995
mane or tail, or, you know, other coat
colors that have this.

143
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:55,290
Now, here's again one of those that could
be either or, and that's

144
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,050
the term sorrel, that you'll hear,

145
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,440
commonly hear especially in the United
States.

146
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,520
It's, people use that rather than
chestnut.

147
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,130
Chestnuts kind of, you know, here in the
United States when we call

148
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,590
them chestnuts, we kind of think of
English riding and European type riding.

149
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,750
And then we say sorrels, you know that's
more associated with

150
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,390
Western type riding, you know, working
cows or going to western shows.

151
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,250
So, they're really interchangeable,
they're, they're

152
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,650
the same thing, just a different term.

153
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,090
So, you'll hear the term sorrel,

154
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,920
and basically sorrel, chestnut are
interchangeable.

155
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,320
Now, the palomino is pretty easy to
describe.

156
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,290
It's very popular in the United States as
a coat color.

157
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,570
And, that's this golden-yellow coat with
this

158
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,700
lighter, you know, yellow light mane and
tail.

159
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,680
And then, a lighter version of that is the
Cremello,

160
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,100
and you can see that, that coat is almost,
almost cream.

161
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,620
And then they have pink skin.

162
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,220
You can see here, pink skin and blue eyes.

163
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,460
Okay, so, little bit, much lighter skin,
much lighter skin tone and in coat color.

164
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,750
Now, we'll jump into the whites or the
white coat color patterns.

165
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,480
And the first one is a horse that is, that
is white.

166
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,460
So this isn't a cremello, it, it doesn't

167
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,080
have any yellowish color to it; it's pure
white.

168
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,210
But it, it's also important to remember
that there's no true albino horses.

169
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:23,800
Albino, albinos that if they, if they are,
if there is an albino horse, they actually

170
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,450
die n utero or during pregnancy, so the

171
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,470
pregnancy never carries to term, and
they're never born.

172
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,900
So you do have, have true white horses,
just you'll never have an albino horse.

173
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,440
Now, the grey horses are basically white
horses.

174
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,580
But they have this, this dark coloring
kind of interspaced throughout.

175
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,680
So, you can kind of, kind of see that.

176
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,470
You know, in this grey horse, where the,
you

177
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,260
know, the hind end is a little bit dark.

178
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,200
Has some dappling right here going on and,
and dark legs.

179
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,310
So, that's a grey, grey horse.

180
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,440
Grey horses are actually born almost
solid.

181
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
Or almost what we'll, we'll call the next
one will be roan.

182
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,280
And then, they get lighter with age.

183
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,420
So, you know, as they age, they actually
get lighter in their coat.

184
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,790
Now, a roan horse is a horse that has
pretty much even distribution of

185
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,430
colored hair and white hair, and it gives
them what we call a roan pattern.

186
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,290
So this is a blue roan.

187
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,740
So you can see throughout that coat, you
know, there's a lot light areas.

188
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,760
So that's that intermixed colored white
hair.

189
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,030
Now, what's also interesting about roans
is the head, tail,

190
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,930
and legs generally are solid off the base
coat color.

191
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,250
So if we look at the three main types of
roans;

192
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,290
there's the blue roan, the red roan, and
the strawberry roan.

193
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,660
And then the blue roan, which is actually
my favorite coat color.

194
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,600
I love blue roans.

195
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,510
Really, really pretty horses.

196
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,950
So that base color is black.

197
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,670
The red roan base color is actually a bay.

198
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,317
And then the strawberry roan color is
actually a chestnut.

199
00:10:56,317 --> 00:11:00,046
[BLANK_AUDIO]

200
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:02,646
Okay, and then finally we're going to
kind of jump

201
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:06,460
into these painted horses or pinto type
horses and.

202
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,500
There's three main patterns that we're
talk about in the,

203
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,307
the first two that we'll talk about are
these asymmetrical patterned.

204
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,970
So, that means it, it's not an even

205
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,390
distribution of, of paint color throughout
the coat.

206
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,770
So, it's, it's uneven.

207
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,260
This asem, asymmetry that we'll talk
about.

208
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,290
So, the first one is, is a tobiano, and
you can see the description there.

209
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,920
White feet and legs, their heads darker.

210
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,080
The while crosses over the top.

211
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,120
In this picture, it's over the neck and
the withers.

212
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,620
And what I like to tell my students is

213
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,830
it's almost as if somebody carefully drew
that pattern.

214
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,940
And actually, my mentor told me this years
ago

215
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,208
that, you know, to distinguish between a
tobiano and an

216
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,670
overo, which we'll talk about next, is the
tobiano

217
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,880
somebody took careful amount of time to
draw that pattern.

218
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,170
So, that's one of the first things I

219
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,980
look when I'm distinguishing between
tobianos and then Overos.

220
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,050
Overos are anything that's not tobiano.

221
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,790
And there's three main types, and the
first one is the frame overo,

222
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,610
so you can see the description there,
tends to have dark feet and legs.

223
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,270
A white head, white sides and irregular
white patterns.

224
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,030
Now, you'll notice in this image, this is
a frame overo.

225
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,330
But, it has a dark head, okay?

226
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,800
So again, these rules with coat color,
there

227
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,280
is some wiggle room in there, you know.

228
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,710
It's, it's not always 100%.

229
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,500
So, this, this is a white overo.

230
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,400
And then, the next type of overo is the
sabino.

231
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,700
And you can see, you really splat, you
know, splotchy, irregular pattern.

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,960
And again, like what I tell my students

233
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,370
is, where tobiano, somebody carefully drew
it in, and

234
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,570
overo is like somebody just went and
splashed

235
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,420
paint all over the place, all over the
horse.

236
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,790
So that's, kind of, how I easily
distinguish them.

237
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,290
Before jumping into some of these other
roles.

238
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,980
And then the final one is this one's
really neat is the splashed white, and you

239
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,380
can see that white really underneath the
horse

240
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,320
up through the throat latch and the face.

241
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,820
And I've read where somebody described
this as almost putting a horse

242
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,870
in a pool of paint, white paint and
dipping them in hooves first.

243
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,890
And then pulling them out and letting them
dry.

244
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,140
And that's almost what it looks like.

245
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,010
So that's, that's called a splashed white.

246
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,810
Now, the final type of, of white coat
color pattern

247
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,890
is in these paint pinto type horses or the
symmetrical patterns.

248
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,250
So it's almost an even distribution of
paint throughout.

249
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,970
And one of these is, is known as the
leopard, and I think that

250
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,400
one's a, a great, you know, example of
what a leopard coat color looks like.

251
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,810
So, that kind of ends the different paint
pinto types.

252
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,400
Now, in the next lecture, we're going to
talk about different markings.

253
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,100
So this is actually showing you the facial
markings.

254
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,730
We'll talk about facial marking and leg
markings.

255
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,400
So, I'll see you then.
