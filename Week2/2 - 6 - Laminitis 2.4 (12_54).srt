1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,960
All right, welcome back, and in this
lecture we're going to

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,720
kind of finish up on, you know, this hoof
care and,

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,560
and, you know, hoof anatomy talk with a
talk on

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,770
laminitis, and I felt it was really
important that we

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,550
devote a little bit of time, kind of
talking about

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,560
laminitis because it is such a terrible
affliction for horses,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,120
donkeys, and other equids Now I start this
lecture off

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,460
talking about Barbaro and for many people
that may remember

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,240
Barbaro, in 2006 he won the Kentucky Derby
in fantastic fashion and there was a

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,070
lot of talk that this was the next Triple
Crown Winner and, and I know

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,380
that we, we kind of say that every year
with the, the Kentucky Derby winner, but

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,980
Barbaro was just such a phenomenal
athlete, that

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,850
people were really starting to, to believe
this.

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,410
And, he was going to the Preakness, which
is the second

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,890
leg of the Triple Crown, and he was the
heavy favorite, and

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,300
he, in the initial stretch run you know,
passing through in

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,740
front of the grandstands, he was suddenly
pulled up by his jockey.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,020
The jockey jumps off and you can see

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,520
there, these were some pictures that were
taken

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,730
immediately, and he had broken his cannon
bone,

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,010
his sesamoid bone, bone and the long
pastern bone.

22
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,330
And so he was immediately out of the race
and everybody's attention you know, turned

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,590
away from you know, we don't care about
the race we now care about Barbaro.

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,950
So, he was carried by an ambulance that
was covered

25
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,250
by the new, all the news channels here in
the United

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,100
States, as they went up the highway to New
Bolton Center

27
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,240
up in Pennsylvania which is a, a world
renowned equine hospital.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,580
And he went under, underwent surgery to
repair those,

29
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,170
those broken bones, as you can see in
these X-rays.

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,330
That's the, the initial broken right hind
leg, and then, after all the surgery he

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,460
went through, which was led by Dr. Dean
Richardson and his surgical team did this.

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,020
And I was actually very fortunate to, to

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,380
listen to him speak after this incident
happened.

34
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,160
And kind of the phenomenal, you know,
skills

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,030
that these veterinarians have in repairing
the leg.

36
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,630
So, Barbaro went through surgery and, and
his right hind leg was, was healing well.

37
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,430
He, he was, he was on the mend and,

38
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,200
and things were looking really, really
good for him, but

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,620
then unfortunately, a few months later, he
started to show

40
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,280
signs of, of laminitis in his hind left
leg, and

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,300
as you can imagine, you know, he couldn't
rest his

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,520
weight on his right legs, so he rest it
all

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,050
on his hind weight on his left leg, and
that

44
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,590
had a, a dramatic impact on the hoof
health there.

45
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,070
So he went through another round of
surgeries, and this is a picture after

46
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,701
some of the surgeries, where they, they
went in and tried to, to help

47
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:40,620
repair some of that damage in that hind
left leg with the laminitis, and

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,380
again he seemed to rebound and do really
well, and he was on the mend.

49
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,480
But then unfortunately again, you know,
with not being able to

50
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,060
put weight on those hind legs, all the
weight was on the

51
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,560
front end of, of Barbaro, his, both his
front legs started to

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,160
become laminitic, and he started to, to
lose function of those hooves.

53
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,791
And just due to the, the, you know, poor
quality of life that, that he was leading

54
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,910
and, and Dr. Richardson actually, you
know, you

55
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,360
could still hear the, the pain in his
voice.

56
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,720
They euthanized Barbaro in January 2007.

57
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,360
And I, I use this story just to kind of,
you know, capture your

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,362
attention and, and to really underline how
important it is to care for a horse's

59
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:28,130
feet, or a donkey's feet, or, or a mule's
feet, and, you know, how

60
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,960
to take care of them and prevent some of
these things that can cause laminitis.

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,170
Now, so now we'll kind of go in to what is
laminitis, and sometimes you'll hear

62
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,890
this referred to as founder, so that's a
common term that, that people use it.

63
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,900
But what happens is, you know, laminitis,
laminae, remember going back

64
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,160
to our hoof anatomy, is you get
inflammation in that laminae, and

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,200
so there's an interrupted blood supply,
and you start to get some,

66
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,940
some breakdown of the lamina sheets that's
holding everything together in there.

67
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,130
So we go back to our hoof anatomy, and we
remember

68
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,500
this, this laminar interface where we have
these interlocking fingers and

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,900
sheets of laminae that are holding that
outer hoof wall with

70
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,700
that inner hoof, and then you also have
the coffin bone here.

71
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,620
So, all of that, that laminae is holding
that in place.

72
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,690
Well, when you get some of this

73
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,980
inflammation and some breakdown of that
interface,

74
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,650
you start to get some what we, we see
rotation of the coffin bone.

75
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,790
So what's pulling on that coffin bone is,
if you

76
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,120
remember that deep digital flexor tendon
that's running down here, okay.

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,170
So when you get disrupted blood supply
here, and this laminar interface starts

78
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,560
to break down, it will start to pull and
rotate that cannon bone.

79
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,910
And I have some more, better pictures of
it, it's going to illustrate this for you.

80
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,400
But that's where we start to see the
breakdown in, in the hoof.

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,960
Now, again, this is a very painful
condition for horses, and if you can

82
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,180
imagine, just like our finger bed, finger
bed, our fingernails in, in the bed.

83
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,990
You know, if we ever get tears there, or
even little infections,

84
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,558
you know, it's extremely painful because
of so many nerve endings down there.

85
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:05,460
So again, like with horses, they also, you

86
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,650
know, have that nerves there that's very
painful.

87
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,920
Now, if we look at the normal anatomy of

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,720
the hoof you can see that and you know,
with

89
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,770
almost the coffin bone almost pointing
straight down, but

90
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,688
not quite, it's almost like they're on
their tippy toes.

91
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:20,530
But, again when we get that breakdown, and
you

92
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,950
can see that, that green arrow that's
showing you that's

93
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,150
where you start to get that, that
breakdown of

94
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,960
the lamina, and it starts to pull that
coffin bone.

95
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,640
Now, looking at these slides, you can see
where that coffin

96
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,400
bone starts to rotate, and then it also
sinks down so

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,740
as that tendon just keeps pulling,
pulling, pulling and it breaks

98
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,210
away from the, the hoof, the outer hoof
wall, it can sink.

99
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,450
And then you can see there's different

100
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,730
case, different severity of laminitis
where it can

101
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,070
be a mild form, where you get some

102
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,490
mild rotation, some moderate or very, very
severe.

103
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,089
And these severe cases are the ones that
are,

104
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,570
that are really, you know, you get worried
about.

105
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,890
And here you can see on an X-ray of

106
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:06,890
a real horse where that bone has rotated
severely.

107
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,510
And then also here in the bottom picture,
you know, a cross

108
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,780
section where you can see those

109
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,180
white arrows are highlighting where
there's inflammation.

110
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,950
And then you actually have instances of
that

111
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,560
coffin bone poking through the bottom of
the hoof.

112
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,690
So again, a very, very serious disease, a
serious condition in horses.

113
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,470
So what can cause this, and what, what can
you

114
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,910
do to manage, to limit your horse from
getting laminitis?

115
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,552
Well, one of the main causes is,

116
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:35,940
is overeating, or specifically overeating
of grain.

117
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,320
And what this does is, is, is grain's a

118
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,720
very energy dense meal, lots of
carbohydrates that gets

119
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,090
in the gut and, specifically, the hind gut
of

120
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,310
the horse, and we'll talk more about
nutrition next

121
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,600
week, and the bacteria there goes, they go
crazy

122
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,580
because there's so many nutrients and then
they, they

123
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,220
start to die off and and when they die

124
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,320
off they release endotoxins that're
absorbed by the horse.

125
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,280
And then carried down through the blood
stream,

126
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,120
again remember that, that blood supply to
the hoof.

127
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,410
And then that's where you start to get the
breakdown of the lamina interface.

128
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,760
Now, another cause is what we call road
founder, and these are on horses that

129
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,460
are either worked too long or too hard on,
on you know, hard asphalt or concrete.

130
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,460
Now if you go back to the hoof care,
that's where we get

131
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,780
into, we were talking about shoeing, you
know maybe get some of these rubber

132
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,868
shoes, maybe with a little bit of extra
cushion, especially on these horses

133
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:32,270
that, that have to work on these surfaces
for, for long periods of time.

134
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,740
And then there's a thing called water
founder, and this is,

135
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,220
you know, imagine a horse that's going
through some intense exercise or

136
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,730
riding and then you allow them and they
get really overheated

137
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,300
and then you go allow them to drink lots
of cold water.

138
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,500
You know that's, again, a shock to the
system, and can result in, in founder.

139
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,360
Couple other causes, sometimes we see this
in, in mares

140
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,040
after, you know, giving birth to their
foals, or through parturition.

141
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,030
If they suffer from a uterine infection
after give, after

142
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,550
giving birth, or if they have a retained
placenta, so

143
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,310
a placenta that's been in, you know,
retained for four

144
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,630
hours or more, you know, they're at risk
of laminitis.

145
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,960
And then there's another one is, is called
grass

146
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,440
founder, and this is horses that are
eating lush pasture.

147
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,040
Now next week again, we'll talk, we'll get
more in

148
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,131
to nutrition and feeding strategies, but
it, it's worth mentioning here.

149
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:32,030
Young pastures, or lush pastures, is
really the young growth, like, you meant,

150
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,440
you know, imagine early spring, lots of
rain, everything, we call it greening up.

151
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,100
You know, the grass is growing.

152
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,540
Well, these, these young grasses and
legumes,

153
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,750
especially when they're really short or
just stuffed

154
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,900
with energy, they have a lot of

155
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,650
carbohydrates, a lot of simple sugars in
there.

156
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,730
And so, if you turn out a horse that's
been eating

157
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,369
hay for a long time, you know, something
that's, that's dry and,

158
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:56,440
and less energy-dense, and you turn him
out on a lush

159
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,090
pasture, they're getting tons and tons of
energy in their digestive tract.

160
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,850
Again, it's almost going back to
overeating.

161
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,730
So, there's different strategies you, you
can

162
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,590
do to limit which we're going to cover.

163
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,630
You know, which leads me right into
management tips, and

164
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,550
the first thing you can do is, you always
want

165
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,800
to secure and store your feed properly and
we'll touch

166
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,080
upon this maybe, a little bit more next
week, too.

167
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,745
You know, horses are, are, are very
inquisitive,

168
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,456
and the picture on, on the right is

169
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:24,639
actually from a video of this Friesian
horse

170
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,176
that was getting in out of, letting
themselves out

171
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:31,424
of his stall, actually it's a pretty funny
video, if you can find it on YouTube, and

172
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:33,725
actually goes by a stall, says, oh, you're

173
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:36,220
not my friend, goes down to the next
stall.

174
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,220
And that's, that's the horse unlocking
that stall to let them out.

175
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,450
Well they'll let themselves out.

176
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,420
They'll go to the feed room, and if your
feed's not secure,

177
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,080
they will gorge themselves and eat as much
grain as they can.

178
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,330
So you know, they're, they're, they're
overwhelming their digestive

179
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,900
tract, digestive system, and that can lead
to laminitis.

180
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,330
So you want to make sure all your feed's
properly secured

181
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,900
and stored, so that a horse does not get
out.

182
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,760
Now, you know again nut, we'll talk about

183
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
nutrient requirements next week and also
how to add

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,150
weight to a horse safely, you know, you do

185
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,440
this in a safe manner rather than
overfeeding them.

186
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,860
And this picture is obviously not a real
horse, if anybody was wondering, but

187
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,248
I just love this picture because you know
everybody always laughs when they see it.

188
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:20,880
It's, it's, it's something I use to really

189
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,860
illustrate you do not want overfeed your,
your horses.

190
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,950
Now getting back to you know, this lush
forage, you know, some strategies you

191
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,300
may want to employ is you know, what we
call limited turn out time.

192
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,324
So especially a horse that's been you
know, eating lots

193
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:41,222
of hay you know, dry hay, over, say, over
winter and

194
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,931
you're going to release them out in the
spring or,

195
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:47,240
or they're stalled a lot or kept in
paddocks a lot.

196
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,110
You know, you have this lush pasture that
you want to put them out on.

197
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,390
You know, day one, you put them out for
20,

198
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,470
30 minutes max and then pull them back,
back in.

199
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,890
And then you increase that time slowly.

200
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,640
And this allows the digestive tract to
adjust to these nutrient-dense grasses.

201
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Other things you can do, you can feed them
hay before you turn them out on pasture.

202
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,710
They do get a thing called gut fill, so

203
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,350
they can fill up their stomachs with hay,
and

204
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,220
then they are not going to graze as much,

205
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,070
or you can get these things that are
called grazing

206
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,140
muzzles, that go over them and they can
nibble

207
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,420
a little bit through there on the longer
stemmed

208
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,340
forage, but these really young grasses,
they have a

209
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,838
really difficult time pulling them up and
getting at them.

210
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:29,880
So, so there's different strategies you
can use to try to limit that.

211
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,240
And then also, horses need exercise.

212
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,360
I mean, especially if they're kept in
stalls or small paddocks.

213
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,970
They need to get out, they need to run,
they need to

214
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,830
get the fresh air, they need to be able to
be a horse.

215
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,230
It's not just for their mental well being,
but also for their, their physical health.

216
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,076
You know, and hoof health.

217
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:51,670
So again, if, if you are keeping a horse
stalled, you do not, they need

218
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,260
to get turned out daily for at least an
hour, if not two hours or more.

219
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,790
And then just finally, proper hoof care.

220
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,700
I mean, this is where, you know, the
purpose of, of covering these last

221
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,320
couple lectures is again, to underline how
important it is to care for their feet.

222
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,250
Because if you go back to that first
saying, no hoof,

223
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,020
no horse or no hoof, no donkey or no hoof,
no mule.

224
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,740
You know you need to really take care of
their feet, and manage

225
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,120
them nutritionally to prevent some of
these

226
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,650
you know, terrible disorders that we see.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,229
So, now we're going to turn to some fun,
more exciting than, than laminitis.

228
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:31,100
It, it's just, I, I think laminitis is

229
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,460
something that we really, really needed to
cover.

230
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,640
But next, we're going to start going

231
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,520
into things like coat colors, identifying
horses.

232
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,976
You know, we'll look at markings, and then
that will wrap

233
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:47,879
up week two, so

234
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,560
I'll see you then.
