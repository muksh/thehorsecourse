1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,524
All right, so
welcome to Week 2 of The Horse Course.

2
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:09,102
And here I am at the beautiful horse
teaching unit here in the University of

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:10,777
Florida's, kind of near campus,

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:14,660
we're about five minutes from main
campus in Gainesville, Florida.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,200
And we're, we're sitting on about 40
acres that we use to teach a lot of our

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,830
students about horses, horse care,
and we actually have a riding arena

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,180
where students learn how to, you know,
ride and have fun with their horses.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,830
So we're very,

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,600
very fortunate here in our animal sciences
department to have this facility.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,520
And I'm lucky enough that we actually have
another facility about 30 miles south

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,170
in Ocala, Florida.

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,415
We have 355, or 3,
about 355 acre equine sciences center, and

13
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:45,900
that's where a lot of our mammas and
babies are right now.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,874
So in some of our, our future lectures
you'll see some images from there and, and

15
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:50,860
videos from there.

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,820
So we are, are actually very, very lucky
here at Florida to have a wonderful equine

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,960
department, equine faculty and
animal science department you know,

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,150
and able to, to give you this
information through Coursera.

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,860
Now, going into Week 2 we're going to
cover some basic physiology,

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,500
we're going to get into hoof care,
you know, hoof physiology, laminitis,

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,030
really the importance of why, you know, we
need to take care of those horse's feet.

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,260
And then we're going to round out the wee,
the week talking about coat colors and

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,960
coat markings.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,800
Now, don't forget to take the quizzes.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,870
You still have time to take Quiz 1 and
Quiz 2, so

26
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,500
those deadlines are a little bit longer.

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,040
And then this week we actually
are starting the, the own a horse project.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,739
And we have to have strict deadlines
with that because we are doing peer

29
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:38,955
evaluations.

30
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:43,650
And so we need to,
you to get your work submitted so

31
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,450
next week you can go in and evaluate three
of your peers and give them feedback.

32
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,870
So look into that, watch the video that we
posted on there describing the project,

33
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,490
and go ahead and submit that.

34
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,860
So the first week has been phenomenal.

35
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,460
Again, you know, this is the second
iteration of the horse course.

36
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,140
In the first iteration we had
close to 15,000 students,

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,710
learners from around the world.

38
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,960
This time we still have over 5,000
from over 130 different countries.

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,180
So there's over 5,000 of you out there,
and it's just, it's, it's, it's awesome.

40
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,430
It's amazing to me
the reach of this course.

41
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,030
You know, a couple shout outs
to Baoyi from inner Mongolia.

42
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,860
I know I posted and said, you know,
welcome to the course in his thread.

43
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,320
I was really excited to
see somebody from there.

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,690
And then again,
Lily from Tampa a young lady who,

45
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,663
who came after last summer, after watching
the horse course the first time, came and

46
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:38,768
visited with me with her family.

47
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:41,230
And she, I saw she was enrolled again.

48
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,170
And then Genesis one of my
ex-students who graduated from here

49
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,030
is also taking the course,
so shout out to them.

50
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:53,190
And then just quickly, you know, there
were some really really cool threads week.

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,890
Julia had a thread, she's from Delaware.

52
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,930
You know, asking what's the purpose
of a zorse or a zonkey, and you know,

53
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,800
without, you know,

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,060
jumping into the thread there, I thought
I would address it through the video.

55
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,070
I think it's more of a novelty thing.

56
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,518
I think that's why people, you know,
breed these animals, to kind of see.

57
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:14,255
Unlike when you had a mule, you know, that
animal was bred for a specific purpose,

58
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,795
you know, crossing the horse and donkeys.

59
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:18,003
Whereas the zorse and

60
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:21,368
zonkeys are more just kind of
a novelty thing in my opinion.

61
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:26,332
And then Vasiliki, if I, if I'm saying
that right, from Greece you know,

62
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:30,725
asked about American Indians,
you know Native Americans and horses.

63
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:36,300
And in my lectures, you know, I talk about
how horses originated in North America,

64
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,893
and then went extinct about 10.000
years ago from this part of the world.

65
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:45,956
And they weren't reintroduced until the
Spanish came and the conquistadors, and

66
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:49,785
some of their animals got away from them,
or the Native Americans, you know,

67
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:51,750
got their hands on them.

68
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,900
And then those horses and, and

69
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,530
the wild American horses that
you see became established.

70
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,319
So it wasn't until then did you see
horses back in this part of the world.

71
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:09,380
And then Nazaret from, the Canary Islands
started a post on local breeds,

72
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,730
from around the world and
people are posting images.

73
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,620
So I, I, I highly suggest you, go to that
thread, look at some of the pictures,

74
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,170
it's, It's, It's really great.

75
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,250
And the interactions between the students,
between you all in the first week has just

76
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,100
been phenomenal and let's keep it up for
the next few weeks.

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,140
So I'll check in next week,
beginning of Week 3.

78
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,880
Have a great week.

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,490
See me on the, the message boards.

80
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,610
If you have any questions,
please, you know,

81
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,730
feel free to join in and, and
get in there and ask your questions and,

82
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,280
and other students or myself will
go in there and try to answer them.

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,514
So, I look forward to
seeing you next week.
